38,38.0,45W0V8CovLAA,MICE DEVELOP AUTISM-LIKE SYMPTOMS AFTER COVID VACCINE,"Given that proper safety testing was not conducted before the mRNA COVID shots were rolled out to the public, independent researchers have been compelled to conduct their own research. One such study reveals new findings indicating Pfizer’s mRNA causes autism-like outcomes in newborn mice. 
#Autism #Mice #MouseStudy #Pfizer"," Pregnant women used to be the last people that would ever get an intervention because of the vulnerabilities of the child and the mother.  And so, like Peter Hotez said, during the COVID development of the vaccine, we needed time to do this.  They eventually settled on about 320-something days to get that vaccine out.  Gavi's now saying they want to do it in 100 days or less.  But the problem is, no long-term studies, and they can't possibly know because they're not even looking for it.  So, here's independent researchers, not associated with the U.S. government, that are looking at some of the long-term issues for the children born to these mothers that have had the COVID vaccine.  And this was a mouse study or a rat study.  But regardless, there's some findings here that are really concerning.  Prenatal exposure to COVID-19 mRNA, this is Pfizer's vaccine, induces autism-like behaviors in male neonatal rats.  So, it goes on to say, our findings reveal that Pfizer's vaccine significantly...  ...significantly alters WNT gene expression and BDNF levels in both male and female rats, suggesting a profound impact on key neurodevelopmental pathways.  So, let's pause right there for a second and unpack that because we're talking some medical jargon here that a lot of viewers probably aren't going to keep up with.  So, let's jump out to another research study.  What is a WNT signaling pathway?  Because they're saying that this significantly alters it, this vaccine.  So, we go to this study, WNT signaling in neuronal maturation.  In synaptogenesis, it says, the WNT signaling pathway plays a role in the development of the central nervous system.  And growing evidence indicates that WNTs also regulates the structure and function of the adult nervous system.  WNT components are key regulators of a variety of developmental processes, including embryonic patterning, cell specification, and cell polarity.  Kind of a big deal.  So, you don't want to really screw around with those.  So, let's go back to the Pfizer COVID vaccine autism study.  The researchers say this.  Notably...  Male rats exhibited pronounced autism-like behaviors characterized by a marked reduction in social interaction and repetitive patterns of behavior.  They go on to say, furthermore, there is a substantial decrease in neuronal counts in critical brain regions indicating potential neurodegeneration or altered neurodevelopment.  Male rats also demonstrated impaired motor performance evidenced by reduced coordination and agility.  So, these researchers go on to say that, hey, this is just a rat study.  It's not one-to-one for humans.  But...  More research needs to be done.  Long-term studies need to be done.  Because no one's doing them.  Pfizer's not doing them.  The U.S. government is not setting out to do these.  These are researchers that are just looking into this because of their own curiosity.  And this is what they're finding.  So, this is why we're reporting this.  Because we need other researchers to step up here and do the job the government's not doing.  Absolutely.  It's really disturbing.  And this goes back, right?  This is that question a lot of people have.  Well, what about the other vaccines?  You know, this is the COVID vaccine.  What about the other vaccines?  All sorts of...  Studies like this, too, on the other vaccines that ask the question.  And when we've looked into it with all of our research, you cannot find any ability  for science to refute, to truly refute the idea that vaccines are contributing to autism.  And once again, when does autism start going like this from one in 10,000 to now one in  roughly 30?  Exactly at the point where the vaccine program starts exploding.  So, you know, there's a smoking gun.  But, you know, whether or not it's truly a smoking gun, it is definitely...  It's definitely a signal, which is all science has to look at.  It's the only key function you have.  Is there something that's sparking off at a given, you know, specific time?  And what should we look at that lit that fuse?  That's what we think needs to be done.  And ironically or shockingly, there's one product that keeps being left out of that investigation.",1645,72,0,0,-1,-1,12.0,Bitchute

Well, this is called somatic symptom disorder or somatiform disorder, where you can get physical measurable symptoms because of a mental disorder. This is of course a very light and common example I gave here, but the principle applies for a whole lot of other chronic diseases that can make your life really difficult for years and every doctor it despairs because he can't diagnose anything specific except for stress and anxieties.

But what I will say is people who care about you care about you through thick and thin. If you aren't doing well, let somebody know. Speak to your closest friend. Speak to a family member who you have a good, solid, positive relationship with. Find someone who you love and trust, who is supportive and non-judgmental and just tell them you're going through a rough time and see where the conversation goes. Because it's that first time of opening your mouth and saying, I'm not coping. That's the hardest.

Fuck Bitches, Get Money"," No, EFPs don't have ADHD. I often hear and see that EFPs get diagnosed with ADHD or ADD. I think this is actually incorrect and is simply due to their personality. But oftentimes, mental health professionals don't care about this and just want to stuff them full of drugs, permanently changing their brain chemistry. So I find that EFPs lean into this belief as well, seeing they're so emotionally driven and also due to TI trickster. I had this one EFP I knew and he would get very, very aggressive after not taking his medication for a short period. And after people confronted him and said he had to chill out or he couldn't do that, he would say, well, I have ADHD or I haven't taken my medication yet so you can't blame me. Clearly, there needs to be a better solution than to just put your child in a vegetative drugged state. And I would say that's proper understanding of typology.",1251,"Subscribe for a free Croissant

That morning light exposure is going to also trigger the activation of dopamine release, dopamine being this essentially feel-good neuromodulator. The best way to conceptualize dopamine is that, yes, it's part of the reward system, but it's really the molecule of motivation and positive anticipation. That's really what it's about. And I should mention that the cortisol is going to be released in a pulse once every 24 hours, no matter what. It's coming, as we call it, it's an intrinsic rhythm, but you can time it by viewing light and or by getting exercise early in the day. There are actually data to just kind of emphasize what happens when you don't do this. They showed that if that cortisol pulse shows up later in the day, and especially if it's around 8 or 9 p.m., then it's associated with depression. By shifting that cortisol pulse earlier in the day, you ameliorate some of the symptoms of depression. And because of the dopamine release, you get this overall mood enhancement.",34717,"How Dopamine Release Can Prevent Depression

Yeah, my mood's just been going up and down lately. I've been feeling super bipolar. Really? I didn't know that. Are you having manic difficulties? Are you more of a depressive state right now? What do you mean? Like, are you having the persistent elevated mood and irritability and activity level or the persistent, you know, depressed mood? Neither, I don't, that's not what's going on. Okay, well, are you having inflated self-esteem or grandiosity or lack of need for sleep or being hyper-talkative? No. Are you having like flight of ideas or just increased distractibility or like continue to do activities that can lead to really bad consequences? No. Okay, so you're having significant depressed mood, loss of interest and activities, fatigue, feeling the worthlessness? No, why do you keep asking me this stuff? Because this is the part of the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. No, I just mean that I'm being moody. Well, then you should say that you're feeling moody instead of invalidating the experience of individuals with that actual diagnosis.",835,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,Youtube

Stay FOCUSED on what you need to do for your Mental Health Recovery and that way you will be there for the ones that you LOVE. Who knows... you may even be able to lead by example, which might even help your friends and family in the end. 

So take the time that you need for your Mental Health Recovery and Focus on your needs so that you can be there for others when you can. 

I HOPE you stick with me on my journey to help motivate you for better mental health and we will get through this together! Because I know we can!

Also, she claims she is poor and asks people for money and gifts. But the craziest thing is when she said she had Tourette syndrome, autism, and even eating disorders. So a follower reached out to her dad on Instagram and asked him if Bunny was ever diagnosed with autism. And guess what? Her own dad revealed that she wasn't. He said that the only diagnosis she ever had was dyslexia.

Avoiding your fear triggers or situations is called Experiential avoidance. It is the tendency to avoid uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and it is a key factor in how anxiety, panic disorder, health anxiety, agoraphobia and even OCD develops and is maintained.

When some people experience high anxiety, they often misinterpret those feelings to mean that they are in danger or that something terrible is happening and that it can get worse. 
They may have physical symptoms like a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, or sweating. These symptoms can be frightening, and it's natural for people to want to avoid them.

But when people start to avoiding thoughts or environments and situations that they associate with anxiety, they inadvertently reinforce their anxiety. Avoidance sends a message to the brain that the feared thought, situation or bodily sensation is dangerous, which can trigger the fight-or-flight or freeze response and make the anxiety even worse.

Over time, avoidance can lead to a cycle of anxiety, panic or OCD. People may start to avoid more and more situations, which can limit their daily activities and make it difficult for them to function normally. This can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, dread and hopelessness.

Experiential avoidance is not just limited to panic disorder or ocd. It's a common pattern of behavior that can be seen in many different types of anxiety disorders, as well as depression and other mental health conditions. The good news is that there are effective treatments available that can help people break the cycle of avoidance and anxiety.

An effective treatment, a particular type of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) called ERP Exposure and Response Prevention therapy, involves gradually exposing people to the feared situation in a safe and controlled environment.

Fear can be conquered with exposure practice, patience, consistency and determination. It isn’t instantaneous or immediate. It is slow, methodical, committed work and it is committed determination that tames the beast.

That's the perfect place to go if you have depression. Dissociate and Starbucks for a little bit. We got drinks. They didn't have what I wanted. I wanted a hot matcha, but I had to get a hot chai instead, but it's okay cause she's so good. Now we're going to go set outside and do this work. We just finished doing work in Starbucks. We set outside because the fresh air was refreshing and it's getting cold. I have to sort these on. Outside work. I definitely feel like we did a lot and I feel very productive after doing that.

Don't do anything that's based on just one moment. Because moments change all the time. Why would you buy into one moment and change your whole life based on how you felt then? But interestingly, we get fooled. We think I've always felt this way. So don't forget to remember who you've been your whole life. Connect to who you are and what you want.

And they then isolated something called adrenochrome.  They found that the adrenochrome could actually produce schizophrenic symptoms,  could cause hallucinations, delusions, and so on.  And adrenochrome is an oxidized product of adrenaline.  And adrenaline often occurs when you're under stress.  And people who have the genetics for it can then develop these oxidized stress hormones  that are then capable of actually poisoning the person.  If you had the right genes, if you had the right genetic structure,  and now there's evidence for that,  which would allow...  the conversion of too much adrenaline to adrenochrome,  which was a hallucinogen in the brain,  that if this happened, that this would act on the brain as if they had taken LSD,  and they would then become psychotic.  With adrenochrome, your legs seem a very long way down.  Your clothes may become uncomfortable.  And, particularly if you're convinced that something is wrong,  you're almost intolerable.  Small distortions can be even more frightening than large ones,  because you can't be sure that they are distortions.  And as tension mounts, so does one's uncertainty.  Ours is a simple, comprehensive hypothesis  that wasn't based upon chance.  We actually derived our hypothesis from  very careful observation that had been made by Tomji Osmond, John Smith and myself.  That was our hypothesis.  Ours is the only rational hypothesis there is.  The average psychiatrist will not answer your question,  ask him what causes schizophrenia.  I don't know.  They think it's biochemical.  They use the word biochemical,  but they don't understand what that means.  Because when you load someone up with a toxic drug,  you're not giving him a biochemical treatment.  You're merely poisoning him.  And it's easy enough to poison people.  That's no problem.  So there are no theories that are acceptable except ours.  To offset the effects of adrenochrome,  we turned to the cheapest, safest,  and most easily available substance,  niacin, vitamin B.  We now by that time knew that niacin might protect the cell  against the effect of adrenochrome.  So I decided that we would try niacin.  It's 37 years since I was ill.  I have recovered.  Completely.  I always think of my recovery as taking place in about three weeks,  or 19 days to be exact.  The theory that Dr. Hoffer has,  that the adrenals produce this toxic adrenalutin,  and that's like LSD in the body,  that fits my story.  And I think my own part in it was overdosing on sugar.  I loved my sweets.  I wasn't aware.  I didn't realize.  I know that sugar can affect my mind.  And he said,  we'll put you on the niacin and watch what happens.  And I didn't have any expectations.  But something happened.  I make recommendations for vitamins or supplements,  always in terms of cleansing and building.  And I make recommendations for diet.  It became mandatory for all my patients that they would all go on to niacin.  I used drugs too.  The vitamin didn't work fast enough, and the drugs did.  So the best solution was to combine them.  So I'd start my patients on the drugs,  which would help settle them down very quickly,  help take away their anxiety, their hostility, their depression.  Start them on vitamins.  And we used the drugs as you would use a crutch for a person with a broken leg.  As soon as the leg is mended, you throw away the crutch.  As soon as our patients are mended, we throw away the drugs.  And I think that's how they ought to be used.  So that's why we get the recoveries that we see by the combination.  This is what's called orthomolecular.",331,5,0,0,0,0,1.0,Bitchute

Now, depression doesn't start the day you can't get out of bed. In reality, very few people suddenly become debilitated by depression. Mostly that builds up over years of struggling to keep your head above the water while meeting all of life's expectations at the same time. So you can be deeply suffering with the symptoms of depression, even though you're still getting by doing everything that you're supposed to do. That's why it's called high-functioning depression. And because outwardly, everyone can see how well you're coping with life. So it can be even harder to tell anyone because you feel this deep shame and you can't imagine how anyone would even believe you. So your suffering stays silent. But high-functioning is not the same as happy and healthy. The term high-functioning is not a clinical diagnosis, but depression is. And the fact that you can make it to work or school every day does not mean that your mental health couldn't benefit from some work and some support.",1814558,"Subscribe to me @Dr Julie  for more videos on mental health and psychology. #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #shorts

97,97.0,FQmpzbZ6s6rm,Your Consent Is Not Required. The Rise in Psychiatric Detentions & Forced Treatment..,," My name is Rob Wypond. I'm an investigative journalist.  During the research on my book, your consent is not required.  These are the more startling, disturbing, and shocking things I learned.  The danger of calling 988 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is real.  Depending on what you say, your call could get traced and you could be taken forcibly to a psychiatric hospital.  I got the documents through Freedom of Information Requests. Let's take a look.  The managers of 988 are Vibrant Emotional Health.  They also run the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and a slew of other mental health hotlines.  Their ads claim that all calls are anonymous and confidential.  But their call attendants routinely contact 911  to initiate traces and send police around to take callers to psychiatric hospitals.  Some news media have fact-checked this and claim that it only happens when callers are  actually dying or actively trying to kill themselves.  They just quoted someone from Vibrant spouting this.  In fact, Vibrant's own policy makes very clear this isn't about imminent death.  It's about trying to figure out which callers  sort of sound like they might be at imminent risk.  Basically, these are people who innocently called to talk, believing it would be confidential.  But if a call attendant gets a sense that you might potentially take your own life in a few hours, days, a week,  that's enough to trigger a trace.  And the documents I got show that these police interventions happen at least tens of thousands of times a year.  On the other hand, the police are not only trying to kill themselves, but they're also trying to kill themselves.  A hundred times every day, and possibly much more.  Some journalists call it a remote possibility.  But Vibrant admits it's 48,000 people per year, or 2% of all calls.  Is a 1 in 50 chance actually remote?  And in fact, internal data show that callers with suicidal feelings are only 17% of all calls.  So it's apparently 1 in 10 of these people.  In my book, I show how the National Suicide Commission  and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, now 988,  is probably one of the single biggest funnels into psychiatric detentions in America today.  All sorts of people report having terrifying and terrible experiences of betrayal,  having called just to talk, and then getting hauled off and locked up.  Even Vibrant's own lived experience committee has for years been criticizing this abusive practice.  Nevertheless, during the hearings about setting up  988, Vibrant went to the FCC and Congress  and asked for direct control over much more expansive powers  to potentially track the geolocation and personal information  of every single person contacting them.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention.

#facts #shorts #autism #asd","Autism Spectrum Disorder affects 1 in 36 children. Boys are nearly 5 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability that often presents with challenges before the age of 3 and lasts throughout a person's lifetime. There is currently no medical detection blood test or cure for autism spectrum disorder. Being non-verbal at age 4 does not mean that a child with autism will never speak. Hyperlexia, the ability to read above one's age or grade level in school, commonly accompanies autism spectrum disorder. There is no cure for ASD, but there are several interventions that can help children learn important skills that improve everyday life.",15,"Help me create more videos. Please like and subscribe!

#patrickmartinlcsw #thementalhealthtoolbox","Hi, are you trying to figure out how to support a friend who is hurting? Well, in this quick video, I'm going to give you five tips to get you started. Tip number one, let them lead the conversation. two, practice active listening. That's why we have ears and one mouth. three, ask. what kind of help they need. four, be silent. this is also known as the sitting Shiva. in some cultures, when people are grieving, they just want someone to sit with them, sometimes for a week, two weeks, just to quiet and keep them company without having to talk about the problem. five, offer to link them to other support systems and resources. you could even offer to do some research with them because oftentimes when you're feeling depressed or anxious, it's hard to do things on your own. So just be that support for them and help them do some of the groundwork. Okay? Hopefully that was helpful. be well. keep thriving. bye-bye.",110,"In this video, I discuss 5 tips on how to support a friend who is hurting.

What they do is they meet at the American Psychiatric Association,  they meet in the DSM Committee, Diagnostic Statistical Manual Committee,  and they vote on making new behavioral and emotional disorders,  and they vote, and then they start immediately calling them diseases.  And they tell people, they tell the public these are diseases. Total fraud. Total fraud.  The actual truth about chemical balance  is that it's an actual lie.  Nobody has yet measured, demonstrated, or created a test  to show that somebody has a chemical imbalance in their brain. Period.  What the American public should be thinking about  is when they or their loved ones or their friends  have received a psychiatric diagnosis,  they should be asking the dog, the cheese dog,  where's the chemical test for that?  Where is the objective test for this?  And I guarantee you that there will be  people who will be told,  we don't have a chemical test for that.  There are no biological tests for any mental illnesses that I'm aware of.  There are not current available tests to verify your diagnosis.  There is no test. There is no specific test to differentiate between,  let's say schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Not a single test.  There are no, not really confirmatory tests for the diagnosis.  There is no test, there's no biopsy you can do  that says this person is depressed, this person is bipolar.  We don't have anything really currently to identify mental illness per se.  No, there are no specific tests to confirm the diagnosis  to show the improvement like any blood tests or any x-rays or anything like that.  In my practice I don't do any tests.  I just speak with people and listen to them  and then I make a decision in what kind of illness there should be.  We don't have, we don't really have any specific blood tests  or other tests that are definitive for any mental illness whatsoever.  What kind of biological tests do we have available today  for detecting mental illnesses?  None.  There is no rational science behind what they think is the cause of these symptoms.  The medications that are being given to people are without exception  introducing chemicals that are altering the brain in ways which can be very damaging.  And I'll go a step further and say that in the absence of a proven chemical imbalance  for which the medications are, quote, rebalancing or fixing,  the medications are in fact toxic.  How many patients have you been able to cure so far?  I would say one.  How many people have I cured?  Well, there are no real cures right now in psychiatry.  Ha ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  You ask me about the issue about how many people I've cured,  I don't know that any of us are ever completely cured of anything.  I have not been able to cure many patients.  I have cured none of my patients.  I have not been able to cure any of my patients.  So you have to ask the classic Roman question, legal question,  cui bono?  Who benefits?  The people who make the diagnosis.  The people who make the diagnosis.  The people who make the diagnosis.  The people who make the diagnosis.  you try.  I see.  Which you, for instance, have been realized about.  Are you able today to identify who that person is?  Can I have your scientific advice on how to treat these patients?  I am trying to understand the Tylenol.  I don't know how you can know what it is,  because I've always wondered about that one in my life and yet have not decided how to treat this patient better.

These disorders are similar. For quite some time, avoidant was actually conceptualized by many researchers as a more severe version of SAD. This is called the severity continuum hypothesis. This hypothesis has mostly been abandoned in favor of the idea that the two disorders are distinct constructs. Both disorders involve avoidance. The main difference between the disorders is connected with the motive for avoiding social situations. Fears of rejection and feelings of inadequacy motivate people with AVPD to avoid social situations.

#patriciamorgan #shorts #emotional #emotions #emotionaltriggers   #mentalhealth"," Negative self-chatter, those nasty things that we say to ourselves, often said to us by adults in our life that we were stupid or crazy or lazy or no good or bad. Many of those nasty messages that we absorb sometimes come out when we get triggered, when we get angry, when we feel demeaned, when we feel unseen. And I need to remind myself that other people also have their story inside them. And when I get triggered by somebody's behavior, it's about my story. Right? And I want to remind myself that they have their story. It's very hard because it's like doing a dance with one another. Because often we cannot dance without stepping on one another's toes.",78,"This shorts video is about how we sometimes get caught in a relationship dance with our emotional triggers.

One day, while I was walking home from school, I heard a voice calling my name. At first, I thought it was my mom, but then the voice spoke again, and this time it sounded different. I turned around and saw a man standing behind me. He was tall and had skin that was a little darker than mine, and he wore a hooded sweater that made him look like a monk. Hello, the man said. I'm sorry, I do not mean any harm. I just wanted to ask you some questions. I didn't know what to do. I had always been told not to talk to strangers, but this man didn't seem scary, and I was curious about what he wanted. What questions? I'm from a group that studies the paranormal, he said.

www.StephanieLynLifeCoaching.com","There's a difference between emotional health and mental health. Mental health is really the logical stuff. When we talk about emotional, that's the side of ourselves, being able to acknowledge what we feel, validate it, and soothe it. The aspect of what it is that you're experiencing is the ability to use logic to decide how do you actually want to feel. So this is where we tap into free will. We all have the ability in every moment to decide where we want to put our focus and our energy and our attention. That's free will and that's mental health. Being able to take responsibility for yourself to say I'm going to decide, choose to focus on this rather than going down the rabbit hole.",12295,"#mentalhealth #stephanielyncoaching #narcissisticabuse #emotionalabuse #selflove

So I'm going to share a tip with you that worked for me. So when we have an anxiety, it's about the future, right? But the only thing that we have is this present moment right here, right now. So instead of thinking about the outcome, which is out of our control and the future is out of our control, let's focus on the present moment because the present moment is the only moment that exists and it's under our control. So by focusing on this moment and the efforts that we put in for the exam or other event, then we are actually ensuring our success. So let's focus on the present moment and the process and our effort so that we can have a beautiful result and beautiful future. If your mind does take you to these scary scenarios in the future, then just bring it back to the present moment and remind it that we have to focus on here and now. This is the only thing under our control and this is the secret of success.",32,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,Youtube

The doctor is not going to say you have a demon you need to get delivered. No doctor ever is gonna say that. They're going to say you need medication because you have schizophrenia, you have bipolar, whatever they label it. So oftentimes people are being misdiagnosed, thinking they're mentally ill and really they just have a demon. And I just talked to people, someone recently that had was diagnosed, actually she was on our show last week, schizophrenia, right? They said, oh, you're schizophrenic. And I was like, well, how did they diagnose you? She's like, well, I just went, told them I hear voices and see things and they gave me medication.

And that, that's what tricks the brain. I didn't die because of that. Didn't have a heart attack or anything like that. I struggle with coming to people and telling them how I'm feeling.

Because they're a high carbohydrate diet  and there are some presenters claiming that fat is contributing to diabetes.  I don't get that one.  The only fat that can contribute to diabetes is margarine.  Because it's an altered fat, it can actually block the receptor sites.  You see, the brain cell is actually 70% fat, the membrane around it.  It's the fattiest organ in the body.  It loves fat.  It loves fat as fuel.  Now, coconut oil and olive oil are very concentrated foods.  You don't need a lot.  I don't need a lot.  But I would have maybe two teaspoons of olive oil a day on my food.  I don't need a lot.  Love it on my vegetables.  Love it on my soups.  But if I had Alzheimer's,  I'd probably be taking three tablespoons of coconut oil a day.  And in the book Stop Alzheimer's Now,  he gives stories of people who started the coconut oil  and were able to turn Alzheimer's around.  He's also got a book called Stop Autism Now  and shows that the coconut oil,  because it's a neurohealer,  you know, the ketones that it produces,  can actually even turn that around.",1114,27,-1,-1,-1,-1,4.0,Bitchute

And there's actually, if you look at the rates of suicide in teenage girls, not trans-identified teenage girls, just teenage girls, since smartphones arrived, they have gone up quite radically. So all of that is to suggest there's a mental health crisis in children generally. The next and final, or I don't know, final, but the third and most obvious piece of the puzzle is to say, OK, so we totally agree, trans-identified teens. And I would always say trans-identified. I would not say trans-teens as if that's like a permanent fact about them because we don't know. There's a mental health crisis in trans-identified teens as there is in the wider group.

In 2023, now 1 in 36 children is being diagnosed with autism.  Their answer is that they've just gotten better at diagnosing.

J9CON230280","Do you want anxiety relief? We'll take this. It's one of my favorite herbal medicines to really help with stress, anxiety, and even low mood and depression. And it is lemon balm, which is known as Melissa Efficientalis. In this study, it was found that as much as 95% of subjects responded to treatment with Melissa Efficientalis, and 70% of them achieved full remission for anxiety. So that's really promising as a natural herbal medicine to help with that anxiety relief. Now my tip here is to take that Melissa and you can take it in combination with some of my other favorite herbal medicines for stress and anxiety, like valerian, skull cap, and passion flower.

It was very problematic, a lot of people were severely depressed and didn't even know it, they lived their lives as though they weren't depressed. There was something very wrong, don't you think? I think something was very wrong. Why did they live like that? They didn't even know they needed someone to tell them. Why didn't anyone tell them? Why didn't they ask?

Well, I think when you say they're mentally ill, like that, well, give some face to it. I have said, and I will continue to maintain, the gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder, whichever DSM you choose to use, is a mental illness. Mm-hmm. That is... And that... And again, and again. God forbid that it should be said with any animus, because this is not said with animus. When people are suffering, these are clearly folks who are suffering. When people are suffering, you shouldn't be saying stuff with animus. I'm not saying that as a got you to people who are transgender. The point that I'm making is that when a society begins treating folks who have mental illness as though they are representing an objective reality, they are doing no service to the people who actually suffer from a mental illness. My grandfather suffered from schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia. He was institutionalized. If the doctors had said to him, Nate, you're fine. We believe that the radio is actually talking to you.

I talk about this every day on this show. I show you what people are doing on TikTok for views. I show you what individuals are pretending to be, what they are saying. I mean, it's anything for attention. And rather than us saying that we need to address this seriously, you have politicians and the media that are telling you that you need to feel more and more compassion for these people. Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to feel less and less compassion for these individuals. I feel no compassion whatsoever for Jordan Neely. Let's make that clear. And some of you guys are watching this and you're going to say, well, of course, can't have someone who feels no compassion for him because he's a black man and she never defends black men. No, I never defend black criminals. And I never defend white criminals. I have this thing. It's crazy. I just don't defend criminals. I know it's wild. I just don't come out here out of the gates and feel compassion and emotion for people that are spreading harm in our society.",210189,#Shorts #CandaceOwens #News #Politics #Culture #PopCulture #DailyWire #NewYorkCity #NYC #Subway #NYCSubway #BLM #BlackLivesMatter #MentalHealth #MentalIllness,0,0,0,0,831.0,Youtube

80,80.0,ZqWf9Vg3v3eX,Repurposing Psychiatric Drugs for Fun and Profit,Big pharma psychiatric drug scam.  Big pharma will sell you any scam that you will buy.," So around the time that I was waking up about conventional medicine, I would  spend every single Saturday hours reading PubMed articles and discovering  what actual science, not the Church of Scientism, had to say about the untold  story of pharmaceuticals and the evidence that lifestyle medicine has the  power to resolve chronic illness. It's been a minute though and so when this  lovely journal of psychiatry made its way to my PO Box, I was amused by one  specific article. So it's called Beyond Psychotropic, Repurposing Psychiatric  Drugs for Rona Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer. And repurposing is really a  covert marketing term that implies that they intend to broaden the pool of  customers. And remember that when it comes to psychiatry, there are no  diagnostic tests.  So there's no actual valid science that might determine who is in need  quote-unquote of one of these medications, why, and what outcomes can be  expected. And because the diagnostic manual is an ever-ballooning list of  subjective descriptive terms, psychiatry is the blob that is consuming the  populace and no one is safe. Everyone is a candidate and a potential customer. So  why might that be a problem?  The first issue is that  we have no idea what these medications do and that's why it's been easy to  proclaim their relevance in different populations and then reverse engineer a  mechanism, right? So they are very effective for bulimia and anxiety and  phobias and insomnia and for animals and humans and whatever. And the way that  they must work is that they must modulate serotonin or no they're  anti-inflammatory or no they're anti-infective or they have all of  these different mechanisms that have never actually been proven through  valid outcomes. I mean look at one of these statements about fluvoxamine in  this article. There were no differences in symptom reduction. The researchers  speculated that the highly individually dynamic nature of Rona symptoms would  interfere with the ability to discern a treatment effect. And the second is that  we are poisoning the poisoned. So when pharmaceuticals are applied to a problem  misattributed to an unproven pathology, we are creating a bigger issue for a  given patient.  So what are the risks of taking a Tylenol for a piece of glass in your foot  or prioritizing injectables over sanitation and food for a starving child?  The third is untold risks and adverse effects. So if you want to just like  throw on a medication because maybe it'll help and we don't know why or how,  what are the risks of that? Specifically with psychiatric meds, there is a risk of  impulsive violence and very serious dependency if you're taking these meds  for longer than you need.  Even two months. And because we have normalized polypharmacy, you might think it  makes sense to just add on another medication for your non-specific  collection of symptoms that you've been told are caused by an invisible particle  and don't worry about how or why this medication is being used. So if you want  to wake up from the immense confusion represented by the so-called scientific  allopathic medical community, then I invite you to check out a now free,  free series that I am one of the hosts of that really intends to expose all of  the myths and deceptions that we have been sold over the past three years so  that you never take the bait of this kind of nonsense.",429,16,-1,-1,-1,-1,4.0,Bitchute

Although they can have similar traits and characteristics, they're two distinct conditions. What we see is that those with autism have difficulties with learning social skills. They struggle with things such as understanding cues, making eye contact, or engaging in back and forth conversations. anxiety disorder is different because these individuals are afraid and scared of situations. So it's not a lack of skills issue. It's a fear-based issue. They're capable at baseline of having relationships, and they have appropriate communication skills. But they become really anxious or scared in these situations, and this sometimes can look like autism. But the big take home message is that these are not the same thing whatsoever.",1413,Did you know that social anxiety disorder (SAD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are two distinct conditions?

“Are psychiatric drugs really the cause of violent tendencies?”
“What are the most harmful effects of psychiatric drugs?”
“Why is the ‘bio-lab’ theory so beneficial for the medical establishment?”
Stick around until the very end, and find out the answers to these questions, and much more!"," Give us an introduction to where you came from and where you are now.  I guess I'm a recovering physician, you could say.  So I started off my career in psychiatry and forensic psychiatry  and was involved in working with patients in some unusual settings like in jails  and also did a lot of expert witness work and research.  I was an academic physician at the beginning of my career.  And over time, through my personal experience and through reading the research literature,  I began to realize that psychiatric drugs at first, because that was in my specialty,  not only were not actually effective, but actually responsible for causing quite significant harm,  including dying sooner than necessary from just from taking psychiatric drugs  and multiple classes of psychiatric drugs.  And this sort of led me on a path first to be much more conservative in my prescribing practices  and eventually just taking all patients off medicines.",874,60,-1,-1,-1,-1,7.0,Bitchute

There are several risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing BPD, and these include, number one is the genetic component. Research has shown that there may be a genetic component to the disorder. So let's move on to number two, and that is biological. Studies have found that individuals with BPD have changes in the structure and function of certain areas of their brain, and one area that has been found to be affected in BPD is the amygdala, which plays a key role in our stress response. Moving on to number three, environmental factors. Environmental factors can contribute to the development of borderline personality disorder by impacting a person's emotional and psychological development. Moving on to number four, psychological factors. People with other mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety are more likely to develop it.",37314,So let's talk all about the causes & symptoms of BPD and also talk about treatment - how we treat BPD whether it be therapy or another form - if you're asking do I have BPD or what BPD is or want to know more about Borderline Personality Disorder then I have so many videos that talk about this - let me know what else you want to know from me as I am a therapist who practices therapy and specializes in different mental health conditions like Borderline Personality Disorder.,0,0,0,0,63.0,Youtube

93,93.0,aL88xpsBZurE,Positive schizophrenia symptom presentation caused by involuntary exposure to secondhand weed smoke,Involuntary exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke is forced drugging.," Just a quick one documenting a positive symptom presentation  as a result of involuntary exposure to second-hand marijuana.  Which, thank God, I called the cops and they actually did something about it,  so it went away, so this was not prolonged at the very least.  Um, I walked outside earlier and I smelled smoke.  Uh, it smelled like campfire smoke, not marijuana smoke.  So, I presume the tobacco, the nicotine's neurostimulant effect  was causing the gait control theory, so my brain wasn't processing the signals of smell, right?  Olfactory senses were interrupted.  Or olfactory sensory feedback wasn't accurately being processed  because of the gait control effect.  So, if you don't know what the gait control theory is, look it up.  So, but something still felt like, I gotta get out of here, you know, I don't want to breathe this in.  My mind was telling me, you know, your heart rate is increasing, etc.  Just get out, go away, go back inside where it doesn't stink like smoke.  Now I'm pretty certain that was marijuana.  I did call the cops and the smell went away, so they did something about it.  Really quickly, actually.  It was really great.  But, I came inside and, you know, I'm trying to study here,  and I slipped into delusion.  Not quite, but also, yeah, kind of a hallucination.  Not a strong one.  I differentiate delusion and hallucination based on the severity of the artificial reality that can't be real.  And in this one, somehow I slipped into the X-Men.  And, um, movie.  I don't even remember the exact process, but somehow I started thinking about Wolverine.  Killing all these Mexicans in that movie where X-23 makes her first appearance.  I forget what it's called, but it's like the last one Hugh Jackman did in the series.  And, um, Logan.  Yeah, I think that's what it was called.  It was Logan.  I didn't watch it, but I saw that clip.  And somehow that got me to slip into this fantasy of another X-Men movie  where the, uh, striker team goes and raids the X, you know, Professor X's mansion.  Yeah, the X-Mansion or whatever.  And, uh, you know, Colossus turns into metal and Wolverine, like, kills guys.  Because I imagine myself killing guys with the claws.  And I was thinking, well, that's kind of gay compared to the gore that I've actually watched  where they...  You know, take a pickaxe to a guy's eyeball and...  Like, all this wild shit.  Um, but I was in the movie in my head.  I wasn't in this reality.  I was in that reality.  So this means that even though I'm not smelling the marijuana, the chemicals still entered my bloodstream.  And even though I wasn't consciously aware of it, I'm still experiencing, you know, symptomatic issues.  Therefore...  My response is physiological, not psychological.  The psychological is an extension of the physiological.  And it's not a placebo response.  These experiences eliminate placebo response that so many of you aggressively dishonest junkies lie about.

Folate was discovered - WRONG, CREATED! - between 1931 and 1943. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2019, it was the 89th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. The term ""folic"" is from the Latin word folium (which means leaf) because it was found in dark-green leafy vegetables

Birth defectsFertilityHeart diseaseStrokeThe absolute risk of stroke with supplementation decreases from 4.4% to 3.8% (a 10% decrease in relative risk).[12] Two other meta-analyses reported a similar decrease in relative risk.[42][43] Two of these three were limited to people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease.[12][42] The beneficial result may be associated with lowering circulating homocysteine concentration, as stratified analysis showed that risk was reduced more when there was a larger decrease in homocysteine.[12][42] The effect was also larger for the studies that were conducted in countries that did not have mandatory grain folic acid fortification.[42][43] The beneficial effect was larger in the subset of trials that used a lower folic acid supplement compared to higher.[42][43]Cancer[edit]Chronically insufficient intake of folate may increase the risk of colorectal, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, brain, lung, cervical, and prostate cancers.[6][44][45]Early after fortification programs were implemented, high intakes were theorized to accelerate the growth of preneoplastic lesions that could lead to cancer, specifically colon cancer.[46][47] Subsequent meta-analyses of the effects of low versus high dietary folate, elevated serum folate, and supplemental folate in the form of folic acid have reported at times conflicting results. Comparing low to high dietary folate showed a modest but statistically significant reduced risk of colon cancer.[48] For prostate cancer risk, comparing low to high dietary folate showed no effect,[49][50] but the same two studies reported a significant increased risk for prostate cancer correlating to elevated serum folate.[49][50] Two reviews of trials that involved folic acid dietary supplements reported, respectively, a statistically significant 24% increase in prostate cancer risk[13] and a not significant 17% increase in prostate cancer risk.[51] Supplementation with folic acid at 1,000 to 2,500 μg/day – the amounts used in many of the supplement trials[13][51] – would result in higher concentrations of serum folate than what is achieved from diets high in food-derived folate. The second study reported no significant increase or decrease in total cancer incidence, colorectal cancer, other gastrointestinal cancer, genitourinary cancer, lung cancer or hematological malignancies in people who were consuming folic acid supplements.[51] A third supplementation meta-analysis limited to reporting only on colorectal cancer incidence showed that folic acid treatment was not associated with colorectal cancer risk.[52]
Neurological disorders[edit]Conversion of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and vitamin B12. Elevated plasma homocysteine and low folate are associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.[61][62] Supplementing the diet with folic acid and vitamin B12 lowers plasma homocysteine.[62] However, several reviews reported that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with other B vitamins did not prevent development of cognitive impairment nor slow cognitive decline.[63][62][64]A 2017 meta-analysis found that the relative risk of autism spectrum disorders was reduced by 23% when the maternal diet was supplemented with folic acid during pregnancy. Subset analysis confirmed this among Asian, European and American populations.[65]Some evidence links a shortage of folate with clinical depression.[66] Limited evidence from randomized controlled trials showed using folic acid in addition to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have benefits.[67] Research found a link between depression and low levels of folate.[68][69] The exact mechanisms involved in the development of schizophrenia and depression are not entirely clear, but the bioactive folate, methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), a direct target of methyl donors such as S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), recycles the inactive dihydrobiopterin (BH2) into tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the necessary cofactor in various steps of monoamine synthesis, including that of dopamine. 
FOR EDUCATION ONLYREPOSTED.MIRRORED"," This federal government decided we would spray our entire grain supply with folic acid, this man-made chemical.  We don't call it sprayed with folic acid, we call it fortified or enriched.  So if you spin a box of crackers around and you see the words fortified or enriched, that means sprayed with folic acid.  Now let's take a child. They're getting ready for school in the morning.  They have this gene mutation. You've pumped them full of folic acid-laden foods.  Pop-tarts, white bagels, cocoa puffs, cereals.  Now you just dumped folic acid into their body.  And then by the time they get to school, the teacher's calling saying, hey, little Johnny can't pay attention.  He doesn't concentrate, he doesn't focus, he doesn't finish his assignments, he's not following directions.  He's got ADHD. We need to bring in the Ritalin to control this.  And the truth is, ADHD is not even an attention deficit disorder at all.  It's an attention overload disorder.  And then what modern medicine wants to do is give you an amphetamine to speed up,  race the central nervous system to match the pace of the mind.  Instead of putting just amino acids into it.

In this short, she describes the act which gives her daily focus to summon genuine positivity and life affirming spirit. #shorts"," People with depression, we tend to really have a difficult time finding positive things in our lives. In the law of attraction, like attracts like. So for depressed or anxious people, they tend to draw that to them. People that have an attitude of gratitude tend to draw that positivity to them. One of the best ways to keep gratitude is a gratitude journal. It's an easy way to write down things that you're grateful for at the end of the day to keep yourself focused. And so when we start to focus on that glass half full, we can change that brain chemistry. And when we start to do that on a daily basis, we start to see more and more and more positivity that give us that sense of contentment, give us that sense of joy and that peace.",170,"Lori Thompson is a holistic health therapist who has experience with depression.

And we brought them in at nine months and four days.  We were doing one vaccine at a time.  On June 25th, 2007, we brought them in for the pneumococcal shot.  They were no longer engaged in anything or anyone.  They lost their smile.  They just were in their own little separate worlds.  They never held hands again.  They never looked at each other again.

20,20.0,zw9MxhtJZsMu,Autism ADHD Auto Immune Disease caused by ALUMINIUM Nano Particles IN VACCINES,," What are your thoughts on that?  Well, you heard earlier that there's no real concern about aluminum because it's such a small amount,  and so it really shouldn't matter.  But the kind of aluminum that we put into vaccines is a different kind of aluminum that we see environmentally.  This is called a nanoparticle, and nanoparticles bind really tightly to the bacteria antigens,  the virus antigens, the food protein antigens,  and any other contaminants that are in the vaccines that we may not know about.  And we know that the biochemical properties of nanoparticles is that they are capable of entering the brain.  And so we have not evaluated the safety of the aluminum nanoparticle and its injection  and where it goes when it gets into the body and whether it gets into the brain.  Do vaccine ingredients belong in the brain?  No.  Do they get into the brain?  No one has ever studied it, but animal studies using the same chemicals that are in vaccines that we give to children  directly demonstrate that the vaccine ingredients do enter the brain.  We are ignoring this information.  There are scientists in Europe who've actually done studies on the aluminum nanoparticle  and have shown that it can persist in the brain for years and decades.  And so what we're seeing is a large outbreak of neurodevelopmental disabilities,  including Alzheimer's, and one of the main factors that they're finding in the brains of people with Alzheimer's  is the aluminum nanoparticle that's directly related to the vaccines that we're giving.  So we have never studied whether the aluminum that we're giving in vaccines gets into the brain,  and we've never measured whether it stays in the brain and what it does if it does stay in the brain.  But we do know that vaccines are supposed to cause inflammation.  We do know that certain pacients, these are called immunosuppressants,  are supposed to cause inflammation in the body.  But we have more than half of our children with chronic inflamed conditions,  and we've never allowed ourselves to ask the question,  if the vaccines cause inflammation acutely, do they continue to create inflammation chronically?  We have 1 in 5 with neurodevelopmental disabilities.  1 in 10 with ADD and ADHD.  1 in 35 with autism.  1 in 11 with asthma.  1 in 20 under the age of 5.  with seizures. And the autoimmune diseases are exponentially rising, and we are finding  that the viruses and the bacteria that we're injecting into the body, along with the adjuvants,  create something called molecular mimicry, which means the body sees those viruses,  thinking that it's foreign, but actually finds pieces of those viruses that match pieces of the  itself. And the immune system doesn't differentiate between what it's been told to reject  and itself. So it will turn the immune system on itself, leading to an autoimmune condition.  We know this about hepatitis B, we know it about the Gardasil vaccine, and we know it about the  flu vaccine. And we continue to say unequivocally that the vaccines have been studied effectively  and that they're safe, and that's just not true. Psalm 58. Do ye indeed speak righteousness?  O congregation! Do ye judge uprightly? O ye sons of men! Yea, in heart ye work wickedness.  Ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. The wicked are estranged from the womb.  They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent.  They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear, which will not hearken to the voice of charmers,  charming never so wisely. Break their teeth, O Lord, in their mouth.

Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind,  both living and in his wrath. The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance.

The quick answer is yes. When you're feeling anxious, your body is in the fight-or-flight mode of the autonomic nervous system, as if you were being attacked by a tiger. Hypnosis and hypnotic trance will bring you to its opposite, the rest and digest response, bringing you relief. Secondly, when you get triggered, even if there's no threat around you, the subconscious mind is registering a threat from the past. Using hypnotic regression, you can go in your mind to that incident in the past, see what's happening and resolve it where it lives for a long-term fix.",1021,"Will Hypnosis Help with Anxiety ?

And I'll choose you over and over, without pause, doubt, in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you. And I choose you in 100 lifetimes, worlds. In any version of life, I'd find you and I'd choose you. When someone is in the depths of mental illness, they feel like crap. They feel like they're a burden. This is what my husband tells me. It could be different for everybody, but I've come to understand about mental illness. It kicks you where hurt.",2988,"Check the full video here https://youtu.be/BoHFbFIE48g

Like, pick up the bottle and then keep it. Pick up any cup and then keep it. Meaning, keep yourself busy in any work. 2. Read anything or listen to any audiobook that you can easily find in YouTube or Play Store. 3. If this is not the case, then take some water in a bowl, take some ice, then hit that water with a brush in your mouth for 3 to 10 seconds. That's it, your anxiety is over.

It is 12.59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time in the United States in Rochester, New York.  And this is my coping with schizophrenia blog entry for today. Today my paranoia levels are very high. My delusions are very strong. I think people are plotting against me, following me, spying on me.  I haven't gone outside yet today because of my paranoia. My depression is pretty severe. My anxiety levels are very high. My auditory hallucinations are pretty intense.  I will be seeing my peers.  I will be seeing my peer support specialist next week and my therapist the week after that. It's harder for me to go outside when my paranoia and delusions are very, very strong and my anxiety levels are very high.  When I'm paranoid, I don't want to be around other people. I don't trust them. And sometimes I don't trust myself. So I'm having a very difficult time.  I don't want to be around someone else. I have to do things myself day to day. Everything matters to me, so I need help day by day.  I am trying to stick to my daily schedule. I will try to go outside for my physical therapy and walking exercises.  I have been in high school for 20 years and TЕC says thatалыanno don't understand me.  I've already done some work on my computer. I do consumer surveys.  visit postdoctoral Willie  There's not much that's going on right now because I still have pulmonary fibrosis in my lungs.

Sydney's mental health care crisis has been dealt a new blow with 2 private mental health hospitals to close.
Devastated patients say the care they've received has been life-saving and they now fear for the future."," Sydney's mental health care crisis has been dealt a new blow with two private mental health hospitals to close.  Devastated patients say the care they've received has been life-saving and they now fear for the future.  A safe haven for many struggling with dark thoughts and addiction.  The Wesley Mission hospitals at Coggera and Ashfield will close in six weeks.  Patients in shock.  This is absolutely devastating for me. Getting into Wesley had saved my life.  But the not-for-profit argues the mental hospitals are not profitable, running at a loss.  We're a for-purpose organisation but we need to be a sustainable and a viable organisation.  They haven't been able to find another health provider, now hoping a developer will buy the lucrative land.  We want to be part of the housing solution here in New South Wales.  I think if Wesley Mission flog this site off to the highest bidder, they're not acting in keeping with the gospel of social justice.  At Wesley Mission we're committed to doing all the good we can.  Critics question the handling of this by the Wesley Mission, an organisation that has helped so many, didn't ask for any help from the state government.  Instead, opting to sell.  This is going to be a challenge for the community. We need to be investing in mental health services.  Lives are getting lost.  This is a...  ...facility that needs to be stayed open.

Two, avoiding medications. Three, having increased or more distressing hallucinations. Four, increased paranoia. Five, more delusional thinking. Six, getting excited about projects without really following through on any of them. Seven, when my self-care is slipping and I'm having problems with things like personal hygiene. Eight, people are actually asking me if I'm okay or not. Nine, feeling removed or withdrawing. And ten, difficulties with keeping up with daily life. So these are my personal warning signs that I'm falling into psychosis.

Yeah, okay, that's really common for ADHD. There are a lot of reasons for that. One of the reasons is that we often don't give ourselves time to wind down before bed and yeah, that sounds boring, right? So like finding something to do to wind down that's interesting enough that you don't mind transitioning to it but not so engaging that it keeps us from going to sleep is kind of that sweet spot. So trading massages with a partner, doing some puzzles, reading a book, watching a TV show that you've seen before so it's not not all that interesting, listening to a podcast, these are all great ways to wind down before sleep and we want to start doing it well before bedtime.",215377,0,0,0,0,0,759.0,Youtube

In other words, are you really depressed if you can feel good for part of the day? Usually we think of someone who is moderately too severely depressed as being very sad and unresponsive to things, but that isn't always how it looks. But when it does look like this, we call it having melancholic features or a melancholic depression. When someone is able to have a good day or enjoy some things, we call it having atypical features or an atypical depression. With atypical depression, you can brighten up when something good happens. It is a momentary brightening though, and it's not something that you feel for weeks, but you can feel like your mood has lifted usually in response to a positive event, like a party or watching a good movie. With melancholic depression, you don't have much positive response when good things happen. You just feel really low and it just seems like nothing can lift you up.",12627,"WANT TO START IN THERAPY?

Well, first of all, Islam very much emphasizes the importance of getting help when is needed. So this is something we find in both the hadith and the Qur'an. And I think this a core part of our tradition. It's the remembrance that everything that Allah has sent in terms of an illness does have a cure, that He doesn't send any illnesses without cures or treatments, and that we need the humility to go get the help when needed. Also built within our faith is grounding principles. Whether these be the prayers or the remembrances of Allah SWT, or actually relying on Him through our difficult moments and times. These practices are core and they're indigenous to the Islamic concept, and so we should definitely look into them.",94044,"#islam #islamic #health #healty

And if they're scarring, that obviously will not  be conducive to an erection. So, and here's the other point. It's not just scarring, it's  scarring in the entire shaft, essentially, of the penis. So what does this mean? So in people  who have vascular,  vascular problems like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, you know, heart disease, older  80-year-old man with diabetes, they have, you know, if they have erectile dysfunction from those  vascular risk factors, they will have, you know, penile tissue that's scarred and throughout the  penile shaft.

The people that I'm looking at are, you know, 70% of them are less than 30, and they have  virtually no risk factors. So, you know, if they have erectile dysfunction from those vascular  risk factors, they don't have diabetes, they don't have hypertension, they're a 25-year-old guy  with no, nothing, you know, not overweight, not smoking, nothing.

A majority of Americans are never going to go to the guy down the street. They'll pick up their medicine. They're never going to be the guys growing in their garages or basements or addicts.

I hope it’s only 7 years because this 💩 is getting cray-cray… 🤡 ," This is Canada's health minister, Theresa Tam, originally from Hong Kong.  He may have ties to the Chinese Communist Party under the name Tan Yong-Shi and suffer from gender dysphoria.  Okay, hello, is this thing on? Okay, I haven't spoken in a while. My English is not so good.  So let me just clarify a few things. First of all, I want to congratulate another Chinese woman, Olivia Chow.  She's a very smart woman. I know she has a couple of side effects from a vaccine,  but otherwise she does pretty good. So personally, I do not take a vaccine.  I take what you call water. You put the water in the vaccine needle, or you put it in your arm.  That's what we give to all the politicians so that they don't have a side effect.  Certain politicians, maybe the right-wing politicians, we give the real vaccine so that they have a side effect.  And then hopefully after a couple of months, they drop dead.  That's what we want.  So, Canadian scientists have been putting a lot of work into doing this.  Mainstream people, let me see here, let me check my wrist.  Oh, yes, the Science Centre in Toronto, which Doug Ford wants to make into a big casino  to do Chinese rush hour five, maybe film the movie.  But I don't want that. I want a specific thing.  I want everybody.  I want everybody to go get the vaccine, get the Moderna, get the Pfizer, get the AstraZeneca,  get the Regal vaccine, get the heroin, get the Fentanyl, do whatever you have to do to get the vaccine.  Put a needle in your arm and stay home, stay inside, because the virus is going to be very vicious this week.",556,17,0,0,0,0,6.0,Bitchute

If a person is burned out but not depressed, they don't need to be treated with antidepressant medication. The way to address the burnout is to address the factors that led to the burnout.

Georgi is part of the International School of Spiritual Psychology based in Netherlands, an early participant in the emerging Love &amp; Truth Party, and is often the inspiration behind the I AM HERE movement of awakening in the online community.
The TruthLover podcast is presented by Love &amp; Truth Party and features Author, Speaker, Transformational Coach, Retreat Leader and Entrepreneur - Will Pye in dialogue with fascinating visionaries and luminaries exploring Consciousness, the Nature of Reality, Awakened Activism, Individual Awakening and Collective Evolution, Science and Spirituality", I just have you know I could go into self-promotion here but I'm not going to bother because that's  all online but there is something which is really really close to my heart and that is that  many many people hold back from being of service to each other of reaching out and really being  there for each other out of a kind of false sense of ego that they're not ready yet that they don't  have what to offer and instead they begin then to criticize others who are trying to make a  difference like like you like me like uh many many teachers out there uh that's really really  really a shame every single person is of service here and uh that includes being of service to each  other everybody is a channel of the same love peace unity freedom in different ways just by  agreeing to be here we are able to advance in a compassionate way the evolution of all of us  and it's immediately fulfilling you know they did a test on on rats and they found that rats  naturally if one rat is enslaved in a cage the other rats will naturally try and get him out of  the box and they tested the rats and they saw that uh the reward chemical the happiness of the rats  because they were able to free the one rat in the box uh went up dramatically immensely and there's  a sad side to the story because after that you know it's I don't agree with testing on animals  but it does reveal something.  After that they gave the rats antidepressants and then and I'm not totally against antidepressants  as an emergency measure but with the effect of antidepressants on the rats they didn't care  anymore about the rat that was in a cage and the happiness levels went down so let's be like  the rats you know let's return to true nature and really be compassionate towards each other  wherever there's an opportunity and towards us. I love that Georgie there's a Verve song that just  came into my consciousness from many years ago that  talked about numbing the pain but killing the joy the drugs don't work they numb the pain and  kill the joy and it feels that that's uh you know to feel the pain is necessary and a key part of  our of our healing and our integration.

Nobody taught me how to manage my mind or manage my emotions or talk about my feelings. So I didn't, I suppressed them. But suppressed feelings over time it becomes depression. That's why they call it depression. You have to learn how to let them out and how to do that properly and safely in a good way in a safe controlled environment and that is what we're trying to create here today.",1546,"BOOK A JARED SCOTT KEYNOTE FOR YOUR NEXT EVENT: https://jaredscottlive.com

What I’m not an advocate for though is people labeling themselves as their mental issues. Some people like myself have a mental illness, but I am not my mental illness I am Levi. That doesn’t mean at times I’ve fallen in the trap of believing I am my mental illness because I have at times. But God reminds me I am Levi Mack. Not a label. 

Lastly, yesterday I attended my friend’s funeral who recently passed away. Unfortunately I didn’t get to share this message there (I was trying to time when I’d speak and I just send it when I could’ve). But the message was from one of the last conversations Sabian and I had. He wanted to help people who resonated with his struggles one day. With that being said I am passing the message onto myself and many of you to help others who are suffering or not speaking on their difficulties. Reach out to someone you know has a tough situation right now. It could save a life.

83,83.0,8hlqflfjMouP,Wi-FRI causing anxiety and brain damage: PROOF,THE ENDING IS JUST SATIRE AND PARODY," Exposures for radiofrequency electromagnetic waves alters acetylcholinesterase gene expression,  exploratory and muscle coordination-linked behavior in male rats.  Humans in modern society are exposed to an ever-increasing number of electromagnetic  fields, and some studies have demonstrated that these waves can alter brain function,  just some, a few studies, but the mechanism still remains unclear.  Hence, this study sought to investigate the effect of 2.5 gigahertz band radiofrequency  electromagnetic waves exposure on cerebral cortex acetylcholinesterase.  The cerebral cortex is a layer of neural tissue responsible for things like memory, language,  perception, cognition, attention, perception, awareness, memory, language, and cognition.  Somewhat important.  Acetylcholinesterase, as the name suggests, is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine,  which excites the neurons and is responsible for motor function, so it's responsible  for movement.  And, the neuroscience isn't entirely clear on its function, but they do know also that  it has some responsibility for regulating heart rate, digestion, breathing, etc.  So they studied the effect of 2.5 gigahertz band radiofrequency, and they found that  2.5 gigahertz band radiofrequency is more likely to affect brain function.  They also studied the effect of 2.5 gigahertz band radiofrequency on acetylcholinesterase,  the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex.  They tested whether mRNA expression levels were affected, whether locomotor function  and anxiety-linked behavior in male rats was exhibited because of this frequency.  Animals were divided into four groups.  Group one was the control group.  Group two to four were exposed to 2.5 gigahertz radiofrequency.  Group three was the control group.  Group four and five were exposed to 2.5 gigahertz radiofrequency.  Group five were exposed to 2.5 gigahertz radiofrequency.  And, both groups were able to control the frequency of the radio frequency waves from  an installed WiFi device for a period of four, six, and eight weeks, respectively.  The results revealed that WiFi exposure caused a significant increase in anxiety levels,  possibly as a result of neurons not being inhibited, I assume, and affected locomotor  function.  possibly because the rats had started having trouble with controlling their movements  due to not being able to inhibit neurons that are responsible for movement.  Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity  with a concomitant with an accompanying increase in acetylcholinesterase mRNA expression level  in Wi-Fi exposed rats when compared with the control.  So the enzyme activity was reduced, and in response, the cells started producing more mRNA  to try and make up for that decrease.  So basically, the cells are trying to up the production of acetylcholinesterase to regain homeostasis.  In conclusion, this data showed that long-term exposure to Wi-Fi may lead to adverse effects.  What a surprise, right?  Such as neurodegenerative diseases.  Oh no, surely not.  Surely.  We're just conspiracy theorists.  As observed by a significant alteration in the acetylcholinesterase gene expression  and some neurobehavioral parameters associated with brain damage.  Surely it couldn't be.  Surely Wi-Fi couldn't cause brain damage.  No.  Surely not.  No, no, no.  This paper is just misinformation.  We need to get it fact-checked.  If anyone has the phone number of Bill Gates,  I'm going to call him up and we'll fix the whole situation.  Here's your DNA.  Learn to protect yourself, and God bless.  That technology doesn't even exist.  Some of these kind of silly conspiracy theories that are out there.  I hope that's not getting out into the mainstream.",468,3,0,0,-1,-1,2.0,Bitchute

And when we see our children suffering, we find it as parents. What would I say? Kind of lost a bit.

15,15.0,Q0VBGGTqQgs,Kathy Griffin reveals unique PTSD coping methods and links struggles to past Trump-era controversi..,," Kathy Griffin, a comedian known for her extreme anti-Trump stance, recently opened up about her unconventional PTSD coping methods.  Remember Griffin? Her career plummeted after a distasteful photo with a mock-severed head of President Trump in 2017.  Despite the professional fallout, she's trying to stay in the limelight by sharing her struggles with lung cancer and PTSD.  In a Vulture interview, she talked about her cat-cow yoga technique, where she makes animal sounds.  Griffin insists it's for her well-being during PTSD attacks.  Griffin's attempt to connect her personal issues with the broader political climate, citing the trauma of the Trump era, seemed like a far stretch,  especially when considering her controversies are largely self-inflicted.

So the first one is toe walking. So toe walking is kind of walking on your tiptoes when you know you see people do this and kids do this quite often but autistic people will toe walk more often than not. Okay so non-facial expressions. Autistic people have an issue where their facial expressions may not match up to what they're thinking or feeling. Number three is monotone talking. You may have a very monotonal talking voice where everything will just be completely one tone and there will be no deviation from this actual type of conversation. Okay so number four are ticks. You know maybe you jump or you cough or you hit your throat or you like click your finger. Okay so number five is poor motor skills.

95,95.0,WjSmIBg3hPry,"Hallucinogens: antidepressants hype, cubed. ""antidepressants are bad, hallucinogens are good""",," Now to end tonight, an international study has shown that a hallucinogenic drug which is found in magic mushrooms is helpful to patients suffering from depression.  Well here to explain a little more about all of this is our medical editor Fergus Walsh. Fergus, tell us more.  Thanks Hugh. Psilocybin is the key psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms and has been banned in the UK since 1971.  So researchers got a special license for this trial. More than 200 patients in 10 countries took part.  All had treatment resistant depression. At least two standard medicines hadn't helped.  Patients who received a single 25 milligram tablet of a synthetic form of psilocybin did best.  One in three reported a significant reduction in their depression over three weeks.  For one in five, the improvement lasted.  It lasted for at least 12 weeks.  This is where patients at London's King's College Hospital received the psilocybin tablet.  It triggers hallucinations and these psychedelic effects last up to eight hours.  A psychotherapist was on hand because the short-term side effects can be frightening.  Afterwards, many felt their depression subside.  I think at a basic level, they feel better afterwards.  They feel mentally.  They feel mentally clearer.  They feel that they're able to engage with the things that may be leading them to become depressed.  They may have some clarity and insight into why they are becoming depressed.  And with that, you can make a plan about how you're going to move forward.  The drug works on receptors in the brain which help control mood.  Now these images show brain activity in healthy volunteers before and after taking psilocybin.  You can see there's more activity, suggesting it stimulates new connections.  Around one million adults in the UK with depression don't respond to current treatments.  So there's a real need for new therapies.  Another, bigger trial is planned which should show how often patients need to take the drug to have a lasting benefit.  If it's proven to be effective and safe, it could be on the market within three to five years.  Hugh.",225,5,-1,0,0,0,5.0,Bitchute

And so we are here with that sober appreciation and understanding of the magnitude and the scale of our responsibility.  I don't want to belabor these points, but I need to make this point.  The world that we're living in today didn't happen overnight.  It's over the course of decades and decades of neglect that we ended up here across the spectrum.  You can go back to the 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, not just here in California, but throughout the United States.  As we moved away, fits and starts to address the issue of brain health.  And what we have now is a fragmented system, a system that is completely disconnected,  a system that self-evidently is fragmented.

“People stand to profit handsomely from this experimental medicalization—puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, body-altering surgeries … all in pursuit of a lie,” says Brandon Showalter.

Showalter and Jeff Myers are co-authors of “Exposing the Gender Lie: How to Protect Children and Teens From the Transgender Industry’s False Ideology.”

“It’s an ideology that came out of the postmodern movement from the 1980s that is attempting to gain power by confusing people about the nature of reality. And then there’s an industry, medically, that comes along and … they stand to make tens of billions of dollars,” says Myers.

The NIH is funding a study on cross-sex hormones for children as young as 8 years old, according to a document released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Dr. Michael Laidlaw.

The document shows the lower age limit was lowered from 13 years old to 8 years old.

“The U.S. government has no business funding this kind of experimental research, especially on children,” says Showalter, a senior investigative reporter at The Christian Post.

I would wanna be very careful that I'm not linking the two necessarily, but it seems that of all the phone calls that I feel from parents who are desperate, my son's on the spectrum. Got obsessed with this and I won't let it go. Somehow the transgender identification and the autism thing, there could probably needs to be an entire book written about what's going on with this connection. These people who are dealing with these struggles, not just autism, social anxiety, depression, other psychiatric ailments and disorders, they're all very vulnerable to this. And I think that's probably one of the worst aspects of what this ideology does to people. Not only is it false that you can become the opposite sex, it preys upon those who are already having really hard time in life with their mental health, with their psychological struggles, including and especially autistic people.",5048,"Watch the Full Episode 👉   https://ept.ms/Y0502ShowalterMyers

From a fellow ADHDite, ADHDin? I have ADHD. So having ADHD doesn't mean that you can't pay attention. It means that you want to pay attention to everything. In women, the hyperactivity is much more mental than it is physical. So my brain is constantly going a million miles an hour and that's often reflected in how quickly I can speak. It also doesn't mean that you're a bad student. I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA and I graduated college Magnum Cum Laude. I can do work very quickly but I often make careless mistakes so I would turn in an assignment but I'd forget to put my name on it. I'm terrible at responding to texts and emails because in my mind every message is a new task and it becomes very overwhelming very quickly. I really don't like watching movies but I can binge watch a TV show because there's built-in breaks between episodes. I'm always interrupting people when they're talking to me because they'll say something and that will make me think of something and I want to say it to them before I forget. I constantly have music and phrases stuck in my head. It is never quiet in my brain.",71771,https://youtu.be/ozFGCZOwlxY,-1,0,-1,0,162.0,Youtube

I think if you start believing that you have mental health problems, that's when you're going to have mental health problems. And I don't want to disrespect therapy. A lot of people do need it. But my point in talking about this is that mental health is talked about too much is better to not talk about it. It used to be something that people were embarrassed about. You wouldn't want to tell people. Now people make it their personality trait. People put it in their bio on Twitter depressed with two stars, like ironically calling themselves depressed. And that's going to make you even more depressed. Definitely should not put depressed in your bio. Let's say you went through an incident where something really bad happened.

Why? Occasional use of cannabis products like weed will cause a lot of people to be calm and relax. Chronic use can have the opposite effect, and what happens is that over time, if you use it a lot and for many months or years, you get what's called a regulation of the cannabinoid receptors in your brain. It no longer is effective. You can think of it sort of like a tolerance to weed. You know, this will depend upon your own personal genetics, also what kind of cannabis you're using, and how often and much you partake.

J9CON230053"," Ladies, is your anxiety caused by this common deficiency? And it is a low progesterone level. So a lot of women don't realize that their hormones have a lot to do with how they're feeling mentally. So if you've been having a lot of anxiety, even depression, this can be because your progesterone is quite low. But don't worry, I've got some natural tips how to raise your progesterone naturally without the need of hormones. My number one tip is to get more natural sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is very much linked to healthy progesterone levels. Another thing you can do is increase your vitamin C intake. And of course, not from a synthetic ascorbic acid type of vitamin C supplement, more vitamin C foods. So things like peppers are great, whether that is the fresh, red, and green peppers. But if you like the spicy peppers, this will help with your vitamin C as well. Or take a whole food vitamin C supplement.

Well, not from a clinical point of view, but just from an experiential point of view. Being depressed, discouraged, disheartened, pessimistic. Why? I think today, more than in past generations, it's coming from confusion. When you're not sure, it's hard to be happy. Even when things are good, but I'm not sure why things are what they are. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I should put up with any of this. I don't know, and that's depressing. Even if things are good. So it's not problems that depress us. It's the pointlessness. Something happens, no matter how painful it is. We won't get depressed if we can see some sense, some rhyme and reason. What makes us really depressed and crazy is the thought that things happen for no reason.

I mean, things like that, you can range from  Lyme disease to thyroid issues to nutritional deficiencies to sleep-related problems.  And in this assembly line of a health care system that is now 2022, is you go in, you report your  symptoms, you get a drug. And so they're very much integrated together. And even if you talk to  primary care physicians who have enormous amount of challenges in today's health care system,  a lot of like,  tests that I think would be like really critical, full blood panels and a number of other things  often get denied by the insurance company. So they cannot do full workups on people in order to really  determine some of the sources of them feeling unwell. So people who have low energy and have  sleep problems and have other symptoms of low mood are going to be quickly labeled psychiatrically  and then provided a drug.

The second thing that you should do is really go in person. Call pharmacies and ask them if they have your medication and it's something that's involved in the shortage. They're just gonna say no.

So in that moment I had to decide should I drop everything we have and get out? Or should I try to refocus him? I chose to refocus him because I thought he was stronger than that and that he just needed a little extra cushion, a little extra push. I kept the conversation going of positivity. I said, where are you right now? He told me the town. I said, where are you? What's the story? He told me the story. Who are you with? All that good stuff brought him to the moment that we were in. And I was able to take him out of freaking out, being upset.",3559,"TikTok

#shorts #mental #muslim","Two main reasons why it's important for the average Muslim. One is that I think we need to get away from this stigma of mental health being something that is reserved just for people who have problems. And we really need to, as a community, embrace that everybody needs to do work on themselves. And that we're all works in progress and it's just a continuum. It's not necessarily those people who have mental health issues and then the normal people, but there's a spectrum in between and we need to embrace this idea of looking at ourselves and doing work on ourselves. The second reason is from the study of Islamic psychology or understanding Islam through the lens of psychology, what I find that it does for people is that it really gives them a deeper insight into Islam, the religion of Islam as a path for living life as a human being.",838,"Join us for a live session with Dr Abdallah Rothman at 6.30pm on Saturday 27th March

#sociopath #fyp #anxiety #viral",I'm a diagnosed sociopath and I never get nervous. I could get a call from my agent saying that I need to speak in front of 2 million people tomorrow about knitting and I wouldn't care. And I know nothing about knitting. I can't empathize with myself and that includes future Kineca. Not having anxiety and nervousness makes me do some really stupid things. And I never learn from my mistakes. People tell me I'm very charming and charismatic to talk to. I think this is because I feel no nervousness and therefore there's no barrier between me and them. I allow people to be themselves and then I just mirror what they are. Sociopaths are generally very good at job interviews because we lack the nervousness that regular people have. Plus we'll say anything to get the job. Our rosymeys may be creative. I may or may not speak 6 languages including Swahili and I'm a professional stop woman according to my resume.,110078,"Diagnosed Sociopath (aspd) Kanika Batra explains how she never feels anxiety or nerves because she can't empathize with herself.

In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, it was discovered that there are compounds, chemicals, that can increase or decrease serotonin, dopamine. So different receptors on organs of the body are the ways that these neuromodulators can have all these effects. Some antidepressants that have sexual side effects or blunt appetite or motivation. Many, increase serotonin, can be very beneficial for people, but they also, if the doses are too high or particular drug isn't right for somebody, person experiences challenges because serotonin is binding to receptors in the areas of the brain that control those other things as well.",6715,#shorts Join the Digital Renaissance.,1,0,0,0,4.0,Youtube

They're looking to pass Bill C-36 in British Columbia, which seeks to redefine what informed consent means and give power to the government to force jab you for any illness and also to censor anyone that dissents and also seize their property and imprison them.  So if you think that it's an infringement on your freedoms to have something put in your body that you don't want, used to be a time that was called rape, but also not be told what it is because that is what they mean by redefined informed consent.  Well, you can just be imprisoned. Meanwhile, the Canadian Psychiatric Association is advocating for labeling said dissenters as people with mental illnesses.  And you can.  Force them to be, I would say, sedated, but medicated. You can force medicate them because to disagree with these forced jabs is that's a sign of a of a significant mental illness. That's a danger to society. So you can just dispose of people that way.  One of the more alarming things is, and this is coming out of out of the Epoch Times, is that it's said that.  Some of the details in this bill will remain undisclosed until the bill passes into law.  So my question is, if this is the part they're okay with saying out loud that, yes, we can seize your property and we can imprison you if you don't take this thing, whatever we say it is, we don't have to tell you what's in it. If you don't take it, we're going to do that to you. We're going to treat you like a criminal.  If that's the part they're okay with saying out loud, what is this?  What are these?

29,29.0,9sd4dnr5JbMV,Jew scientists find jews are mentally ill. Schizophrenic sociopaths and psychopaths,, jews like to propagate that they're more intelligent than the general population  it's a falsehood lie and misdirection to hide their true nature as malicious usurpers deceivers  swindlers mischief makers and insular tribal menaces in communities unfortunate enough to  host them the great judge of character and human condition william shakespeare depicted jewish  nature in the odious shylock character in his play the merchant of venice countless intellectuals  social scientists writers and commentators over the ages have also concluded jews to be an eternal  problem for humanity titus 1 14 king james bible states not giving heed to jewish fables and  commandments of men that turn from the truth here the bible is calling jews untrustworthy deceivers  it's why they've been expelled from 1030 kingdoms city states and countries since 1200 bc  to the present the aforementioned could be considered circumstantial in the absence of  impartial scientific and social evidence that jews are indeed trouble new scientific evidence shows  they are a problem jewish academics examined the evidence of jewish mental predisposition  and found that jews genetically and disproportionately suffer from mental  illnesses the evidence has always suggested this conclusion but it's now demonstratively  scientific in the past when genetic studies hadn't favored jews  the evidence has always suggested this conclusion but it's now demonstratively scientific in the past  the studies have been quickly buried in almost impossible to find again a recent study conducted by israeli and american scientists has found that ashkenazi jews have a higher risk of developing mental disorders such as schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder manic depression and paranoia the study published in nature communications revealed that a specific gene variation increases the chances of experiencing these disorders by approximately 40 percent among ashkenazi jews and by 15 percent in the general population  the research led by professor ariel darvasi from the hebrew university of jerusalem and doctor todd lentz from the feinstein institute for medical research involved the largest ever sample group of ashkenazi jews out of the 2500 ashkenazi jews who contributed dna samples 1500 were healthy while 1000 were affected by mental disorders related to schizophrenia ashkenazi jews were chosen as the focus of this study due to their genetic  homogeneity which facilitates the identification of differences between healthy individuals and those affected by mental disorders  professor darvasi utilized advanced dna analysis technology to examine the dna samples and discovered two specific variations of the ndst3 gene that were more prevalent among individuals with schizophrenia related disorders  ashkenazi jews with these variations were found to be 40 percent more likely to develop such disorders compared to those without them  as a group jews are considered genetically defective or mentally ill  they're tribal and paranoid in nature they believe everyone is out to get them  this belief isn't misplaced as jews regularly create mischief and menace in their host communities they create groups like the banai barith the anti defamation league  the american israeli public affairs committee southern poverty law center and a myriad of attack dog organizations to maul their host communities  they buy bribe and blackmail they influence peddle they seek to dominate politics  they make money out of their own money they make money out of their own wealth they make money out of their own wealth  they make money out of their own wealth they make money out of their own wealth  professor darvasi in israel has studied ashkenazi jews for many years he told the israeli newspaper haritz current technology allows for very comprehensive dna analysis and the ability to read millions of snp points basically links in the dna chain at the same time which makes for very effective scanning of dna during the first part of the study the scientists checked for the prevalence of the ndst3 gene that was used to test the DNA of the host community  the DNA of the host community  which exists and ninety nine point nine percent of the population  but there are two specific variations of it that stand out among those with these disorders darvasi said  the results of the study found that ashkenazi jews who have the variations  are forty percent more likely to contract the schizophrenia related disorder than those without it  there you have it jews are genetically predisposed to schizophrenia manic depression  and psychopathy this explains much jewish behavior their functionally mentally ill and  schizophrenic it's why they pursue irrational agendas to dominate destroy the world as you  know it and now their inhumane conduct in gaza their religion judaism preaches utter hatred and  manic destruction of non-jews it's no surprise they're carriers of extreme mental illness which  animates their bloodthirsty whims to kill destroy and incite chaos all around them  the mystery behind inimitable jewish malevolence is over they've been found to be insane  you,670,22,0,0,0,0,9.0,Bitchute

#therealm #mandelaeffect #mandelaeffects #disney #disneyeastereggs #disneymovies #comedy"," Every Disney princess meant to represent a certain disorder. So psychologists did a study and determined that every Disney princess has some type of clear disorder. For instance, you know Ariel from The Little Mermaid? Well, you remember all of the thousands of things she collected over the years. That's hoarding and it's a clear sign of OCD. As for this next one, well, you know in Alice in Wonderland she sees talking cats, caterpillars, bunny rabbits, at tea parties and just a whole bunch of psychedelic stuff. Yeah, this is classed as a form of schizophrenia. People who have this disorder even say that they have seen similar things to what is shown in the Alice in Wonderland movie. Weird. But before we continue, which Disney character do you relate to the most? Let me know in the comment section below. So Belle from Beauty and the Beast. She gets captured by a beast and held captive in his castle, but then soon tries to see the good in him. And then she later falls in love with him? That's Stockholm Syndrome. That is where a victim falls in love with their captor. This cannot be a coincidence. So.",7291395,"Make sure to keep updated with all of my content as we explain lots of interesting topics!

He reminded me that I actually didn't want to kill myself, but I just needed help to sort through the mental mess that I was going through. This was a keen moment for turning my 2022 around.

And a secondary segment is the particular manifestation of that, in your case in body dysmorphia. And so, and then the claims that uninformed mental health professionals make that you're at elevated risk for suicide if you're gender dysphoric is erroneous because the elevated risk for suicide is actually a consequence of the general proclivity for depression and anxiety, and not a specific consequence of the gender dysphoria, or at least that's only a small subcomponent of it. That's another thing to know is that the main clump of psychopathological manifestation, mental illness is centered on heightened levels of negative emotion.

Ever wondered what those with schizophrenia hear in the voices? Jerry's groundbreaking investigation reveals a startling pattern, akin to an algorithm in transhumanist terms!
Don't overlook this revealing journey into the hidden realms of mental health. Tune in this Wednesday at 7pm (GMT) for 'Classified'—because some truths are too astonishing to be concealed!
Embark on a journey of exploration, learning, and questioning everything with Ickonic!"," The DSM has over 200 behavioural patterns that are termed and diagnosed mental disorders.  None of these 200 diagnoses can be tested or measured. As much as you cannot pull a  thought out of a person's head and measure it, the only measurement you have are patterns of  behaviour. This is deemed a chemical imbalance in the brain, or what Eli Lilly called a biochemical  imbalance. Jerry Marzynski worked in one of the biggest psychiatric hospitals in the world. He  began to ask those who were diagnosed with schizophrenia what the voices were saying.  The results revealed a clear pattern, or in transhumanist terms, an algorithm. These voices  were consistently negative, they were degrading, they wanted to isolate the individual and talk  to each of them alone. Most importantly, they were not random, whereas hallucinations are by their  nature random. Jerry discovered that his master's degree was in reality a way of entraining future  psychologists into this materialistic thinking, a way of thinking that totally disregards the  unseen. And it should also be considered that these families, such as the Rockefellers and  the Rothschilds, do believe in the unseen and demons, and in fact they worship them.  This is a slow down form of energy here in this reality to various degrees. And one of the main  symptoms these patients reported was a complete draining of one's energy. We also see this happen  when investigators are conducting experiments in haunted locations, with batteries suddenly  draining to zero. Are we treating an energetic disorder as if it was a physical disorder? It  certainly does appear to be the case.  Subtitles by the Amara.org community",386,3,0,0,0,0,1.0,Bitchute

Depression is an emotional state. Major depressive disorder is an illness. As humans, we're reactive, but not every negative reaction is an illness. There's another mental disorder called adjustment reaction with depressed mood. Some people call it situational depression. It's a milder form of the depressive illness that's triggered by a trauma or a stressor. This disorder is defined as having marked distress that's out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor and significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Degree of impairment is generally how we determine the severity of an illness and what kind of treatment you should pursue, if any. With impairment, we look at the degree of problems that it's causing in your day-to-day life in three main realms. Social, occupational, and personal functioning.",31164,"JOIN MY MENTAL WELLNESS COMMUNITY. Take your mental health education to the next level. https://MentalWellnessSpace.com

#shorts #spirituality #religion #jewish #judaism #life #mentalhealth #depression #anxiety #chabad"," So depression means if you add weight to your existence by worrying about it, by fighting over it, by making it important, you're making it heavier. And at some point, your existence becomes so heavy that you can't carry it anymore. Your existence is way too heavy. The solution is live. Put energy into living. When you put energy into living, you don't need to put so much energy into existing. When you put energy into your existence, you have no energy for life. And that's why it's often very helpful when a person is depressed to simply say to them, stop quetching. Find somebody who has real problems and help them. And that is so curing. Life means who needs me. What am I needed? What contribution can I make outside of myself?",9586,"►►Ask Rabbi Manis Friedman Your Questions In His Private VIP Community: https://itsgoodtoknow.org/join-the-community?utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=010101&utm_medium=video&utm_source=youtube&utm_term=description

At least what my beliefs are is that if you have schizophrenia That means that you're really just extremely Extremely sensitive to the spirit world. People with schizophrenia will claim seeing different entities within people or outside of people talking and Communicating with one another. They'll even hear some of the entities speaking directly to them. People will try to claim that they're hallucinations and illusions I do not think that's the case. Mainly because of a chemical compound within the human brain known as dimethyltryptomy There was a study where scientists studied the urine of people who had schizophrenia They found out that 47% of them had dimethyltryptomy and also known as DMT within their urine Dimethyltryptomy is a very powerful psychedelic that allows you to see certain entities. People claim that hallucinations. I truly do not believe that is the case I believe that they're really entities. If you've ever come out of a deep sleep and saw some sort of Hallucination of some sort of entity that was caused by the DMT in your brain And many very spiritual cultures from around the world also believe that schizophrenia are very spiritually sensitive",5003,0,0,0,-1,1,97.0,Youtube

#LSD #Healthnews"," All right everyone, time for today's second new tech exclusive, a new study showing that  a single dose of LSD, lysergic acid diethylamine, can long-term, not just in the short-term,  reduce anxiety and feelings of stress. I've used LSD before. Yeah, it has a, definitely  it has a calming impact and it does last a long time until you then overdose and go through  total delirium. It sort of sets you back a little bit and then you find, ah shit, I  don't really dare to use LSD again. It's fun while it lasted. I remember my three-year  period as a psychonaut. I even wrote a book on drugs. But the problem with this study  is that it's already been done. This is the first major U.S. study into, well at least  recently, into the situation with regards to LSD. They've also done it for MDMA, psilocybin  and iboga. I don't know if they've done a real comprehensive study with ayahuasca,  but you're probably just better off using crystalline DMT because ayahuasca is called  La Perga for a reason. I attempted to do that once. I got some mild audio hallucinations  and felt like shit actually and then passed out because I was tired and it gives you  the shakes and when you're vomiting that hard and with how acidic it is, it's not the  most pleasant drug in the world. It's mainly used as a worm repellent actually, for which  it is second to none.  It's used in modern pharmaceuticals for that purpose. It's used to remove parasites and  the high is secondary, unless you happen to be a tourist going to the ayahuasca club.  But these studies have been around since the 80s and 90s. What's the problem? Height  of the U.S. drug war, scientists weren't generally allowed to experiment with LSD.  They weren't generally allowed to therapeutically administer psilocybin or mescaline or any  of these other drugs because they were highly scheduled, extremely illegal, only a very,  very small number.  A very small number of scientists and health professionals and a handful of universities  and hospitals ever managed to get their hands on anything other than marijuana. And even  that was a hard sell for about 20 years there at the height of the drug war. So the United  States fell way behind on such medical studies for the therapeutic use of psychedelics especially.  But they were being done in Scandinavia, especially in Sweden and Norway. They've been done  in Denmark.  They've been done in the Netherlands certainly. They don't really care about it. There's a  fucking channel run by some Dutch people. Literally all it is is them doing drugs and  talking about the effects.  I got video removed once for giving topical information about datura, which isn't even  illegal and had to take all my trip report videos down. And meanwhile these people literally  they're sitting there taking ecstasy and storing cocaine and hugging each other and it's allowed  now on YouTube. So thanks to the people.

Why? It doesn't make any sense.  So that you can be enslaved printing license plates.  And they hope that you re-offend too so they can give you an extended sentence.  It's basically the name of the game. It's called slavery.  By the way, did you know, in the United States, slavery is not fully abolished?  Still perfectly fine to enslave a person as part of a prison sentence.  That's why you're allowed to force prisoners to work under grueling conditions  for extended periods of time, giving them sub-minimum wage.  They're slaves.  Yeah, isn't that something to chew on?  Most people don't know that, by the way.  But yeah, LSD was pretty fun. Not gonna lie.  It's just that we should have gotten our act together,  and 40 years ago we could have already known that this was a thing.  Maybe then we wouldn't have demonized it so much and lumped it in with crack cocaine.  That's about all. Peace out.",2650,245,0,0,0,0,0.0,Bitchute

One, it's very hard to take your focus off whatever it is that's upsetting you. And if you don't know what's upsetting you, you know, pure anxiety, but you don't know why, it's very hard to take your mind off of the feelings of anxiety. In those states of mind, it feels as if the state that you're in will go on forever. Now, when we're in happy, relaxed states, rarely do we think, gosh, this is gonna go on forever. And yet, when we are in these unfortunate states of mind, we get the idea somehow, we sort of hijacks our perception of time, and we feel like this is never going to stop. If we turn to the body and certain behaviors, we are able to move ourselves along the autonomic continuum. And at that point, when we've done that successfully, and it's actually quite straightforward to do, we are able to think about things differently. We start to get a sense that the way we feel might not be the way we're gonna feel forever. And it's in those shifts that we start to realize, ah, my mind actually is not my best friend at these extremes, but there's a lot more to it. You're only getting the tip of the iceberg in those states.",403702,"Neuroscientist: Do This If You Feel Stress or Anxiety | Andrew Huberman #hubermanlab #neuroscience #chriswilliamson #modernwisdom #mind #brain #shorts #lifestyle #science #lifehacks #tips #podcast

6,6.0,T6AcX4CbqHBV,REVERSING AUTISM WITH NICOTINE - DR. ARDIS,See more Dr. Ardis on Mind Stretch channel," I showed at the Healing for the Ages conference, and I will continue to show the whole world that they are reversing, this is not a joke, the symptoms of autism with nicotine patches, the symptoms of ALS with nicotine patches, Parkinson's with nicotine patches, MS with nicotine patches, Alzheimer's with nicotine patches.  They publish this over and over and over, these positive outcomes of mental illness being reversed with nicotine, and that's all they're studying. What are the different doses of nicotine that do this? There is something about nicotine that turns on the neurological function.  I don't know if you know this, but nicotine helps acetylcholine in the brain communicate information. When you're trying to recall information or speak, the only thing that stops that is when acetylcholine is blocked. Well, nicotine turns on how fast acetylcholine can work.  So nicotine administration, patches, you're dealing with ALS, Parkinson's, I don't care, autism, you should start with a 7mg nicotine patch every single day. And you should ask your doctor, why didn't they tell you about nicotine, because there's published studies on all of these I just mentioned being reversed with nicotine, nicotine patches.  In fact, they've got autistic adults who have aggressive behavior, antisocial behavior, they put them on 7mg nicotine patches for one week.  Their aggression and behavior disappeared.  Wow.  Their antisocial behavior. And then they stayed on the nicotine patch every single day and went up to 14mg, 21mg every day for years.  And the only time they saw regression is when they were off the nicotine patch for 2-3 days and they just forgot to wear it.  Wow.  And then they put it back on. All their caregivers, spouses, all reported all their symptoms were all improved with nicotine.  Then you should start asking yourself, why is the United Kingdom, America, Australia, and the United States all against nicotine?  Why is the United Kingdom, America, Australia, and the United States all against nicotine?  Why is the United Kingdom and Australia, New Zealand and Canada all at once, all these five countries, why are they all this year announcing that they are going to be a tobacco-free country by N-20-30?  Oh my gosh...  And why did Joe Biden say last month that they are the first presidency ever in the U.S. history to put a limit and to reduce now the allowed amount of nicotine in every tobacco product in New York?  Man, not anything else, just nicotine.  I should start storing this stuff at the doctor's who left the conference and texted me and my wife.  There's no other reason.  Lots of stuff.  Lots of stuff.  words and said oh my god all i need to do is filter my water and buy up a ton of nicotine  patches after all i showed and just so y'all know at the healing for the ages conference i actually  showed this they took king cobra venom called cobra toxin and cono toxins which is cone snail  venoms that they found in every covid patient and while we were being locked down in our homes  they were injecting those into mammals all around the world and reporting they can create a glial  blastoma brain tumor in less than 72 hours with these venoms that were found in every covid patient  they could create glial blastomas brain tumors in less than 72 hours and they have the slides  and the electron microscope to show you how fast the brain tumor grew within 24 hours 48 hours and  72 hours then they turned around and they administered three doses of nicotine in 72 hours  and found two of the different doses of nicotine totally obliterated the brain tumor in less than  72 hours  hours whoa like disintegrated 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours they show them side by side  you know there's not a single oncologist in the entire world that's using nicotine to combat brain  cancer no they're going to tell you chemotherapy radiation and we need to cut it out they're never  going to tell you but i showed the whole world at the healing for the ages conference how they're  creating these turbo cancers called glioblastomas with venoms in the shots despite proteins of  covid were found to be cobra toxin they're putting those in the shots so when they're  injecting billions of those inside of you it crosses the blood-brain barrier these venoms do  in less than 24 hours they target the glial blastoma section of the brain it's actually  called glioma c6 cells they all have nicotine receptors on them and that's why the venom binds  to them and then it signals to the brain to lay down a whole much a whole lot more nerve cells  over the venom",840,13,-1,-1,-1,-1,2.0,Bitchute

It's an attention overload disorder. Kids and adults that have this condition of attention deficit or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, they don't have a problem paying attention. They have a problem paying attention to too many things. And in our mind, we not only create thought, but we also dismantle thought. It is just as important to be able to dismantle the neurotransmitters of thought as it is to create the neurotransmitters of thought. Because if I am creating thought at a faster rate than I'm dismantling it, then I have too many conversations going on in my head. Right?

The end result is poor ability to regulate your mood and too much time ruminating on negative things. Here's where mindfulness comes to the rescue. Because mindfulness helps reduce the self-critical thoughts, it strengthens the connectivity in the frontal parietal network and weakens the connectivity in the default mode network. Researchers have shown that not only does the practice of mindfulness help during the period that you're doing it, but if you practice it on a regular basis, you get sustained connectivity and therefore improvement in your depression.",35067,"GET MY ANXIETY BOOK  http://WhyAmIAnxious.com

Covid Virus Vaccine Pandemic Mask Mandate Lockdown Natural Health Movement Mindset Minerals Health Freedom Medical Freedom Tammy Cuthbert Garcia Naturally Inspired Podcast"," So if we view our emotions as symptoms of an illness, for example, because let's face it, you cannot get a drug approved for a setback in life. You can't get a drug approved for divorce. You can't get a drug approved for grief or loss or the fact that you exhibit some socially anxious proclivities in some ways.  But you certainly can get a drug approved if it's identified as a medical illness. And that has been sold to us over the past 40 years, starting with the drug Prozac. It's where the pharmaceutical companies really began to realize if they can develop a drug and market it to try to influence how human beings feel, that they can widen their customer base.  So what generations before those who really suffered from severe mental illness were a very small percentage of our population, we always struggled on how to manage and treat those.  It has been expanded to the point where close to 20% of the American public is on antidepressant drugs. And we have become so brainwashed into thinking that there is such a thing as an antidepressant drug that any challenge that someone might experience.  Emotionally is immediately met with a prescription pod. And the outcomes have been disastrous.",391,8,0,0,0,-1,5.0,Bitchute

Jordan Peterson reveals the truth about depression and why some people are depressed. You may feel sad but you need to think about everything you have in life. Use that emotion as motivation to fuel yourself into being successful. I believe in you"," Are you depressed? Or do you have a terrible life? Or is it some combination of the two? So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell, you don't have a terrible life. You have friends, you have family, you have an intimate relationship, you have a job or a career. Your body's educated as you should be given your intelligence. Use your time outside of work wisely. You're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations. You're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense and all that's working. Now if you have all that and you're feeling really awful, you're either ill or you're depressed. And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route to that, treatment of that. My experience as being as a clinician is if you're depressed but you have a life and you take an antidepressant, it will probably help you a lot. Now maybe you're not depressed. Exactly. You just have a terrible life.",1461,"#jordanpeterson #motivation #shorts #youtubeshorts #motivational #workoutmotivation #mindset #depression #mentalhealth #jordanpetersondaily #jordanpetersonquotes #jordanpetersonshorts

Oh my goodness. Autistic people make the mistake of going outside and going to like do laundry or grocery shopping or going to see their friends in the park and have to walk through a busy street and not take headphones with them. Number two is apologies. You know, you you make apologies and you apologize for your issues. Now, what I mean by this is autistic people may do something that like if they're stimming or they may have a tick and then people on the autism spectrum may apologize for these actions, which is completely ludicrous. Like, you don't apologize for who you are. Okay. So number three is forcing through with uncomfortable situations. Oh my goodness. Like, have you any idea how many autistic people do this?

If you ask me if I am very bad at fuel meter, why do you ask me if I am bad at fuel meter because of the petrol tank empty? Similarly, our sadness, depression, sudden down feeling, all these are not a problem. It is a symptom or a problem. So, why is it a problem? We cannot solve it. For the problems that we cannot take a step, our subconscious mind will be exposed to a feeling and emotions. So, when you start looking for a solution for that problem, the emotion will change. Or, if I think that a motivational song is possible, I will stop for 15 minutes and return to this place. So, until we find a solution for this, we will not be able to leave it. So, do you ask me how to identify the problem? There is a simple and effective method for that. I hope you know this. Subscribe to my channel and tell me in the comments. For that, tell me in the next video, the simple and effective method.

Yes, 100% not even intelligence, any level of ability. Mental health will trick you into thinking that you are less capable than you are. Occasionally mental health will trick you into thinking you're more capable than you are. Have bipolar disorder, it does both. But yeah, mental health will trick you into thinking that's for sure.",34,"Mental health will trick you into thinking you are less capable than you are. Please always be aware of this because if you're struggling with your mental health then your opinions on your own abililties will be distorted by this!


Living with bipolar disorder I am all too familiar with this and it worth noting that when I am in an elevated state mental health will ALSO trick me... into thinking I can do MORE than I can!

These young students have a hard lesson to learn."," My wish for World Mental Health Day would be to normalise mental health amongst young people.  My wish for World Mental Health Day is that everyone feels seen no matter where they are,  how they are. My message to the government would be that we want to be heard, young people want to  be included. I'm 18 in a few months, I'm able to vote so are a lot of my peers so we want to see  the government prioritising mental health and that early intervention. People my age would  definitely say that the space at the moment is absolutely complex and it's just an ever-growing  problem considering the cost of living crisis and then people my age are starting college,  just going to college. Their choices in college and what they want to do with their future is  so limited it's disheartening and discouraging for them.

#mentalhealth #​selfharm #psychsore"," Misconception number sixth, that self-harming is always in the form of cutting. That's actually not true. That's probably one of the most common ones, with overdose being the second most common from the patients I see. But there's loads of different types of self-harming. There's burning yourself, there's like bruising yourself, biting, scratching, picking at wounds and some people use rubber bands and actually you could argue that's a healthier way of self-harming so you don't actually physically damage yourself. It's to cause that, get rid of that kind of urge and release those endorphins. There's lots of different forms of self-harming, that's what I'm trying to say.",4090,"Check out the full video on misconceptions about self-harm 👇

Guess what? I'm managing my med herbs. I haven't taken my medication in three weeks. Does that mean I hate medication? No. Does that mean that it's going to work for you? No. Does that mean that it's dumb for me to suggest that it might be possible? No. Frankly, it's kind of childish to assume that every single thing that doesn't work for you or that would not work for you because you know yourself best is a bad idea. You're actually kind of scaring people away from trying things that may work for them because you're saying, well, this isn't ADHD friendly. Why? Because it doesn't work for you. Honestly, if you hear something and it doesn't work for you but it's coming from an ADHD or and it did work for them, let it go. Find something that works for you instead. Don't downplay other options just because to you it sounds stupid or because it wouldn't work for you personally.

I haven't seen you in so long and you look like you've lost much weight. the reason I brought a mental health specialist into my practice is because it is very clear to me that many people that do all these fad diets and you go up and down and gain and lose weight can't seem to live in their healthiest body or achieve goals because you haven't dealt with the mental health issues of things have scarred you as a child that holds back from doing the things that you want to do to obtain your body or the way that you want to feel. until deal with the mental health side of what's going on inside your head, you will never, ever, be able to successful on any kind of meal plan or exercise program. do yourself a favor and go take care of your mental health.",9871,"Doctor Ricky Brown breaks down the importance of mental health and dealing with your internal issues when trying to create your external appearance and losing weight.

The results showed that negative effect was associated with increased rumination, while positive was adaptive coping. Furthermore, extreme cognitive appraisals were found to strengthen these relationships. This suggests that feedback loops exist between effective states and coping behaviors in the daily lives of individuals with bipolar disorder.

So, that's what I want to focus on today. We've done a prior report on night terrors, which is somewhat similar if you're interested in this show, you might be interested in that video as well.  I actually received an email from a father today, I don't think he'll mind me sharing, I'll be very vague, but he said that his son had night terrors after his vaccine, and he was thankful to have come across my video, where I just listed out a bunch of VARS reports in this category, and a lot of people found that report very interesting.  So, this is in the same vein, no pun intended.  What I really want to do in this report is start with the youngest reports, the youngest aged patients, and work our way up.  But there's something interesting about VARS, and that is that a lot of the records don't have all the data fields filled out.

How many of you like stay at home moms or work from home moms feel the same way that I do? I feel like ever since I stayed at home and I no longer go to a job to work, I feel like I'm a work from home mom because I do YouTube videos as well. So I would consider myself a work from home mom, but ever since I don't go to work anymore, I feel like I lost a little person part of my personality. Like I feel like I used to be so outgoing before I used to talk to people. I'm always so happy and energetic. And ever since I'm at home and I just talked to the kids and no one else, I feel like I lost that part of me. Definitely leave me a comment down below.

Perhaps your significant other has dumped you, or maybe you're sick and tired of being poor or living in this dystopian world into which we've devolved. Canadian 'socialists' have the solution heretofore only found on socialist media: go kill yourself, press 5 if you'd like government 'socialist' help."," The not-so-shocking turn of events that is the dystopian world we live in, Canada, it turns out, is killing poor people.  I wish I was making this up.  In 2016, it became legal for any Canadian citizen aged 18 or older who had a reasonably foreseeable terminal illness and death  in the near future to commit suicide through a physician-assisted suicide program funded by and administered by the government  if they could get two doctors to sign off on it.  Since 2016, that's expanded to both physically ill and mentally ill people in Canada seeking out euthanasia.  And next year, it's set to be the most expansive euthanasia program the world has ever seen,  which would include adults, children, physically ill people, mentally ill people, and poor people.  In the last year the data was available, 10,000 Canadians committed euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide,  in one calendar year alone, making it the sixth highest.  And it's the highest-leading cause of death in the country.  So we're literally just telling people now, just to be clear, that it's better to be dead than to be poor or depressed  or dealing with a mental illness.  It's better, it's more dignified to be dead.  And, and, that the government should pay for it?  Forgive my youthful ignorance, but at what point in human history was it ever a good idea for human rights  or progression of a society for the government to euthanize people?  Who were disabled, mentally ill, or poor?  Hello everybody, this is Kelly Lorenz, we're going to dial 8-1-1 here, it's Saskatchewan Health.  Thank you for calling Healthline 8-1-1.

Imagine  having exactly what you have now, but with fewer white people and more Asian people in charge.  Yeah, that's really what it is.

It's Eurasia forever, man. Calorgi's dream of the  Eurasian muck, man. I wrote this today. I said, the Putin-tired ziggers on the degenerate American  week outside are engaged in the Duganite version.  of accelerationism. They want to exacerbate geopolitical conflict between West and East  to bring about some kind of nuclear showdown. They basically say we will be saved by getting  killed in a Russian or Chinese nuclear strike. You will die and be reborn, goy. Just eat Putin  and Xi's nukes and be saved. They're depressed and suicidal losers who just want it all to be  burned down. They have no intention of fixing anything, hence why they're putting all their  eggs in the Eurasian muck basket.  On the one hand, they try to sell you the idea they're running a third party that will break the two-party false paradigm, while they shovel other false dichotomies like Russia vs. NATO, Eurasianism vs. Atlanticism down your throat to convince you that you must support Eurasian muck. Glory.  Ain't that the truth, folks? That's what this is. These people who are pushing this Eurasian crap. This Putin-tiredism is rooted in this idea. It's like accelerationism, but for, like,  national politics, right? It's like, let's accelerate the conflicts. And you hear them talk about this. This is, this seems to be one of the only issues they care about, right? They say, don't talk about the COVID issue, don't oppose COVID, don't call out the WEF and Klaus Schwab, and don't call out Bill Gates for what he's doing, and don't point any of this stuff out.

They lie to you about your body to sell you unnecessary drugs and procedures. Angry yet? This is why it is vital people understand these lies. We all vote with our actions based on our level of awareness. "," When I went to medical school, there were only six or seven items in the manual.  Now there are over 300.  I mean, you mean to tell me that there have been 294 diseases discovered in the last 60 years?  In psychiatry alone?  It's a joke.  It's an epidemic of psychiatry that we are dealing with.  We don't have an epidemic of mental illness, we have an epidemic of psychiatry.  You eat too much, it's a disease, it's an addiction.  You smoke too much, it's a disease.  You are too unhappy, it's a disease.  You are too thin, it's a disease.  You are too fat, it's a disease.  You have too little sex, it's a disease.  You have too much sex, it's a disease.  No free will, it's all chemicals.  No self-discipline, no self-control.  The chemical imbalance meshes very well with the idea that you give a drug,  which restores the balance.  It's a story, a mythology, a fable.  And that's the baseline from which we are operating now in America.  The child doesn't perform the way he should or behave the way he should.  He is not responsible.  Some chemicalist will give him a chemical.  You hear day in and day out on television that this is a mental illness and that's a mental illness.  And Zoloft is advertised.  Beer you can't advertise, but Zoloft you can advertise.  Now this is not...  It's not just psychiatry, it's the whole psychiatrization of the culture.  Now what's more toxic, Zoloft or beer?  Amen.  Case closed.  See the internal contradiction in these very concepts is so total that they don't stand up to any scrutiny.  Nobody has yet measured, demonstrated or created a test to show that somebody has a chemical imbalance.  A chemical imbalance in their brain.  Period.  Psychiatrists are getting more and further and further and further away from this human to human touch.  And they're becoming more and more quacks.  Where they talk and act and impersonate doctors.  They talk about diagnosis and treatments and the brain and all this kind of stuff, about which they know nothing.  Zero!  It's not science.  It's politics and economics.  That's what psychiatry is.

And a lot of the times I ended up forgetting who I was, I definitely lost grip on reality and it triggered my psychosis. If you are someone who is living with a psychotic disorder of any kind and thinking about trying some of these substances, I would definitely be very cautious and give a lot of cautious advice to maybe think twice about it or have a regimented plan or even talk with your doctor about it first because there is an elevated risk for triggering psychosis with these substances.",42323,"New Living Well With Mental Illness PODCAST! https://www.youtube.com/@livingwellwithmentalillness

#EncounterTV #DavidDigaHernandez #God #BibleVerse #BibleTruth #Anxious #Anxiety #PeaceOfGod #TrustGod #Christian"," This one Bible verse has the power to defeat anxiety. If you come to really understand the truth revealed within this powerful Scripture, that truth will free you from the grip of fear. But this must be more than just something that you acknowledge or understand in your natural mind. This is a truth you have to receive in your spirit. Here's the verse, Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee. The key to peace is focus on and trust in God. As simple as that might sound, it's not always easy to do. When you focus on your troubles, you inspire fear. When you focus on Jesus, you inspire faith. Now, this doesn't mean that you should just ignore life's troubles. This just means that you should keep life's troubles in perspective by looking at God's ability. Fear asks what if faith boldly declares even if.",230594,"#Shorts

When really, I'm not a therapist, I just have schizophrenia. So I almost think that my friends almost appreciate me more on occasion, because they feel like they can be open more and talk to me more, and tell me more about their problems.

So when most people are having a panic attack, they're really focused on the breathing in part and getting as much air into their lungs as they can. But by doing that, you're allowing your chest to expand, which allows more blood to flow through your heart, which inevitably makes it beat faster. So although it may seem counterintuitive in the moment, focusing on taking long deep breaths out rather than in will actually decrease that fight or flight instinct a lot faster by decreasing and normalizing your heart rate.",197808,0,0,0,0,0,268.0,Youtube

322,,_aPT9EpeDZU,John Doyle on depression #whateverpodcast #depression #shorts #suicideprevention,," because I don't think women are happy, I don't think men are happy, and I don't think that they experience depression the same way. Women tend to experience depression in a much more environmental sense, meaning they are directly affected by their environment. If they're unhappy, I think that makes them depressed. Men experience depression when there's no way out of that environment. I think that we are perfectly okay with going through something, but if we don't see a way out, because of all the progress that women have made, we've had to tilt the scales so you guys have a greater advantage in pretty much every aspect of life. And men just don't see that light at the end of the tunnel. That's why we just kill ourselves. That's why the common thing is like, well, yeah, men are more likely to kill themselves, but women are more likely to attempt it. Okay, well, why would that be? Because women are like, I'm upset, I'm in a man, and men are just like, yeah, I'm not going to get out of this, and they blow their head off or something. I think that speaks to the differences in our natural predispositions as men and as women, and I think that we need to acknowledge that for what it is and restore what would be considered a more traditional set of gender roles in society.",7628,0,0,0,-1,1,53.0,Youtube

Knowing what we now know about dopamine and the fact that having enough dopamine is required in order to coordinate these neural circuits that allow for focus and quality decision making. Equally valid idea is that these children and these adults are actually trying to self medicate by pursuing these compounds. Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine. Well, what happens was when somebody with ADHD takes that drug, it turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus. Their ability to focus on things other than things they absolutely care intensely about goes up. Likewise, children who consume anything that increases their levels of dopamine, if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer.

42,42.0,wBTDH9soJdsR,The Latest Deadly Outbreak Of Highly Contagious Mind-Control (OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DELUSIONS) O.C.D,"OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DELUSION (OCD) is a treatable anxiety disorder that affects more than 6.8 + billion people world-wide. It usually develops in early adult-hood after many years of repeated indoctrination programs of academia, mainstream media and official government mind-control propaganda. Without proper treatment (OCD) can become a chronic condition. As the name suggests, there are 2 kinds of symptoms:
    OBSESSIONS — unwanted thoughts, images or urges that repeatedly come into the mind, propagated by Mainstream Media, Academia &amp; Corrupt Governments.    COMPULSIONS — repetitive behaviours or rituals, of which there are many, including (wearing a face mask and getting jabbed repeatedly for fictitious viruses that don’t even exist) 
Once fully indoctrinated, these compulsions are very difficult or impossible to stop. They are generally carried out to reduce anxiety brought on by official deep state co-ordinated mind-control programs.The best method and application for reversal of (OCD) is to…#1 Cease all connection, communication and affiliation with MSM, Academia and Government &amp; all people involved. #2 Purchase a powerful hi-fi audio system.#3 Obtain the music collections of the following Metal bands… &amp; (m)any others like them KREATOR, MEGADETH, OVERKILL, CARCASS, EXODUS, DEATH, DARK TRANQUILITY, ARCH ENEMY, (just to name only a few) #4 Play their music as loud as you can !#5 Memorise and project the lyrics at the threshold of your throat (DAILY)#6 Feel free to consume moderate amounts of alcohol and/or cannabis to alleviate chronic symptoms of forced mind-control (ONLY IF ABSOLUTLEY REQUIRED)   #7 Repeat until individual thought patterns begin to normalize and Obsessive Compulsive Delusions neutralize.

21,21.0,INIlA8WL6mo6,Does ADHD lead to Mental Illness?,"In this video, I discuss the relationship between ADD/ADHD and mental illness. Anxiety, depression, bi-polar, schizophrenia, and ADHD all have shared symptoms.  My argument is that these shared symptoms are the real disease and the manifestations of the mental illness are relative to one's sex/gender, race, culture, personality type, etc.  I'm not exactly saying ADHD leads to mental illness, but that there is a connection."," Howdy. Today I wanted to talk a little bit about the relationship between ADHD, attention  deficit disorder, and its relationship to mental illness. One thing I noticed is that  I personally have had ADHD most of my life, which is why I've never got around to making  this video. But the thing is, is that I noticed when I looked up a lot of the symptoms of  mental illnesses, like from depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar, they all had shared  symptoms. And it occurred to me, it made me start thinking that, you know, when you're  young, you usually don't get diagnosed with mental illness, but when you turn into an  adult in your adolescence, that's when you start being identified as being mentally ill,  and these labels come about. And so what I did is, is I noticed, again, the shared symptoms.  I made some really generic, what I would call, well, they're terrible. I mean, they're  kind of embarrassing, but they're just really quick. I made some of these, okay? That's  for bipolar. You can see there's shared symptoms there. I got these out of the diagnostic  blah, blah, blah, estheticians, whatever, for mental illness or whatever, and I just  wrote them down really quick, because it came to me in a flash, right? So that's bipolar.  That's schizophrenia. And then you take a look at depression. You also see that there's  shared symptoms.  And with anxiety as well. So, and a lot of these things, they come together, anxiety  and depression. And so one of the things that I noticed, again, was that these symptoms  were shared, and it occurred to me that if you thought about people's culture, their  age, their sex, gender, and all of that, how it all, how these, this ADD manifests  itself when you turn into an adult. If you fail to develop adult coping mechanisms, you  might make yourself a little crazy.  So,  I think it's really important to look at the pathways in the brain that are related to  ADHD and these mental illnesses. And I think that you will find that a lot of people, invariably,  their problems might be actually coming straight out of being ADHD. That's not to say that  there's people out there that have glandular issues or a tumor growing that creates, you  know, too much hormones, and that will change your behavior. I'm talking about people who've  had trauma that had, were consistently normal, and then through adult life, they ended up  with these mental illnesses. So, I really think if you feel like you've ever, you know,  had these mental illnesses, ask yourself, if you might have ADHD, and see if there's  a relationship, because you might find that just curing your ADHD will take care of all  those other problems. I know that was a big awakening for me. And, um, another thing is  I found some mushroom information related to this. I'm going to do that in another video,  but I'm going to talk about that they found that psychedelics basically work on the same  pathways as this.  And that ADHD, and these mental illnesses, I don't think they're going to leave you  without it.  So I'm going to go ahead and close this out.  my contact information is www.MyControlBot.com.  And that will give you a lot of information on how to deal with the problems that you're  and these, I think, depression and anxiety they found were related.  So, at any rate, I just wanted to throw that idea out there  and take a look at it for yourself.  Again, just an idea to think about, and thanks for listening.",1016,1,0,0,-1,-1,4.0,Bitchute

However, whenever you explain some regular person on the street it seems like they tell you to simplify when you don't know how to make it more simple. A prime example for me is whenever I try to explain anything I do to fix a computer. I think I dumb it down a lot however most other people don't.

1 PETER 5:6-7
Amidst life’s hardships, God lovingly tells us to cast our anxieties on Him (1 Pet. 5:7). He knows our heart and cares deeply about every aspect of our life. As we surrender our fears and worries to Him, we experience the peace that surpasses all understanding and find comfort in His unfailing love.
In a world marked by stress and anxiety, God offers an anchor for our restless souls. Many of us are beset by storms and feel as if we must navigate life’s challenges on our own. But the truth is, we have a heavenly Father who is ever-present and eager to handle our anxieties.
As believers, we’re not exempt from worry, but we are called to approach our fears with a different perspective. That is, we’re invited to shift our focus from the problems surrounding us to the One who holds the universe in His hands. God’s care for His children is not limited to the grandiose; it extends to the tiniest details of daily life.
Casting our anxieties upon the Lord is an act of surrender, which requires acknowledging our limitations and embracing His sovereignty. Though submitting in this way may not eliminate life’s challenges, doing so helps us face them with courage and trust.💖💖💖"," Philippians 4 6 says this, do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation by prayer  and petition with thanksgiving, present your request to God. I love those words in every  situation. That means there's nothing too small to bring to him. All of us have experienced worry,  stress, doubt, and anxiety at some point in our lives. We have situations that come against us  that knock us down and make us feel like giving up. Anxiety is incredibly difficult,  but our God is greater. Let me tell you how. The rest of that verse goes on to say this,  and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and  your minds in Christ Jesus. You see, when we pray, God hears more than we say, answers more than we  ask, and gives more than we can imagine in his own time and in his own way. If you're feeling anxious  today, it's going to be okay. It's not easy to pray when you're in the middle of a storm. Once  you pray and ask God for his help, let go of it.  And leave it in God's hands. Lean on him today, and don't you ever give up.",216,4,0,0,0,0,4.0,Bitchute

When things don't go my way, please remind me that Your plans for me are better than what think I want. Teach me to not let the pressures of this world get to me.

#clevelandclinic #shorts #schizophrenia #mentalhealth","Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition. It disrupts how a person's brain works and can cause enormous struggles in their day-to-day life. In the active stage of schizophrenia, the person loses contact with reality. They may have delusions and believe things that aren't true. Hallucinations, seeing or hearing things that aren't there, are common. When they speak, their sentences may be jumbled or incoherent. Or they lack emotion or expression. Most people with schizophrenia are not able to recognize their condition. They often try to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol. If you believe a loved one is living with schizophrenia, encourage them to seek help. Treatment is available.

#shorts","Marijuana or weed linked to schizophrenia? News in under a minute. Experts are concerned about the increasing use by adolescents and young adults, and the evidence is growing the marijuana's association with psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. New research is adding to worries that heavy use of high-potency cannabis and legalization of recreational weed in many U.S. states could exacerbate the nation's mental health crisis in young adults. Thase C. potency is a significant factor in the risk for psychotic disorders, with higher doses consumed increasing the likelihood. Adolescents and young adults are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis as their brains continue to mature. It's crucial to educate the public and regulate the concentration of THC in products. People with a family history of a psychotic disorder shouldn't use cannabis at all.",6,"Marijuana or Weed linked to schizophrenia - news in under a minute May 28 2023

——————————————————"," Guys, what's going on? Welcome back. Yes, we're talking about hand flapping and autism, where we talk about flappy hands and stimming. So stimming stands for self-stimulatory behavior, a repetitive soothing notion that people in the autism spectrum do to feel calm when they're overly excited. Now, excitement and anxiety are the same feeling, but this is a big but. I did a video that went viral on TikTok and Instagram about how when I was in supermarkets and toy stores and stuff like that, the light flicker that I can see because the autistic brain allows for you, as an autistic person, to see the light flicker, right? The light flicker. And then you put your hand there and do this. What happens is you're counteracting that cross phase so that the wave phase is going this way for light and your hands are doing the exact opposite, which cancels out the flicker of the light. So when autistic people are doing this in front of light, what they're actually doing is creating a constant light which is more soothing and less triggering.",8336,"📘50% OFF AUTISM PARENTING MAGAZINE → http://bit.ly/AUTISMPM

And that's what it is. It's the one thing you can control when you feel like there's chaos is what you put in your mouth and your body. So that was for me, after going through a unique situation and feeling that my whole life was out of control, I just manifested as an eating disorder.

How to Help Someone with an Eating Disorder","Eating disorders often first appear in teenage years and there'll be a spike with stress involved in going to university unfortunately. Up to 10% of people will have actually experienced disordered eating at some point in their life and university can certainly bring that on. Eating disorders have a variety of forms whether that's anorexia, bulimia or binge eating. They're all very common issues. Often it can be difficult to approach somebody you're concerned about with an eating disorder. I'd recommend the are you okay approach. Asking, listening, encouraging and checking in. Often people will push away. They say they don't want to talk. And that's fine. Don't push them. But do ask again at a later point. You might not get someone to open up to you but it might make them realise they're not alone and they then seek their own help. It's vitally important that people feel able to seek help for eating disorders. Even more so if at university that's been the trigger and they're thus away from their normal support groups. Remember recovery is possible but the first step is going to be talking to somebody.",12096,"Eating disorders are more common than we think, especially among teenagers and those who experience stress, such as students in university.

In my own experience people suddenly care a lot when you hit rock bottom, make an attempt or become outwardly ""crazy"" when you have fell so deep you can't function and when this happens people accept that person needs some time of too rest.

What about before that point though? If a person can feel that point hardening towards them and they are trying so hard to keep themselves a float but people can't see that yet so they decide to take that time of then all of a sudden that person is lazy or a hypochondriac, unless God forbid they attempt and succeed and then suddenly ""we wish they had talked to us"" 

If we allowed people to take the time they needed to recover and rest before they hit the bottom of the ocean and need resusitating I think the world would be a much better place with a lot more people in it. 💙

334,,-HSKuYeOZyY,How to Deal with Anxiety #shorts #trending #anxietyrelief 3thingtodo,"When experiencing anxiety, grounding techniques can be helpful in bringing you back to the present moment and reducing feelings of panic or overwhelm. Here are three things you can do to ground yourself during anxiety:

1. Practice deep breathing: Taking slow, deep breaths can help regulate your body's stress response and reduce feelings of anxiety. Try inhaling slowly through your nose for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this process several times until you feel more grounded and centered.

2. Engage your senses: Focusing on your senses can help you stay present and connected to your environment. Try to identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present moment and reduce feelings of anxiety.

3. Guided Imagery: This technique involves imagining a peaceful and calming scene in your mind, such as a beach or a forest. You can listen to guided imagery audio recordings that can help you visualize the scene and become fully immersed in it. This can help reduce anxiety by providing a mental escape from stressful thoughts and situations.

Remember to be patient with yourself as you practice grounding techniques. It may take some time and practice to find what works best for you, but with consistency and perseverance, you can learn to manage your anxiety and feel more grounded and centered in your everyday life.

This is not a medical advice. Do consult a qualified therapist if you have severe issues managing your anxiety.

494,,6mLnW-g39Rg,The Natural Antidepressant: How Fish Oil Can Help Improve Your Mood and Mental Health #shorts,"Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist who has conducted research on the effects of fish oil on the brain and its potential use as an antidepressant. While there is some evidence to suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish oil, can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression, the research is not yet conclusive.

One of the key ways that fish oil may help with depression is by reducing inflammation in the brain. Inflammation has been linked to a range of mental health conditions, including depression, and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.

Speaker : Andrew Huberman @hubermanlab 

#hubermanlab #science #depression","I feel like more people should know about this. This is nutrition, but it's profoundly affecting mood and depression is terrible, right? Depression can have a component of anxiety in some cases where people are, they feel lousy and very uncertain. That's kind of how I talk about depression with anxiety is you know, you talk to someone who's anxious and you can tell them everything's gonna be okay, okay? And they're always concerned about what might, they might not know. You don't really know the plane isn't gonna crash. You don't really know that life is gonna go okay. And in some sense, they're right. No one has a crystal ball or can predict the future, but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty. And then of course there are the versions of depression that involve certainty. People are lethargic and they're certain they say, I'm certain I'm never gonna get another job. I'm certain I'm never gonna meet anyone new. I'm certain I'm gonna fail. There's this divide in the sphere of depression around certainty and uncertainty. But what's interesting is this 1000 milligrams per day where more of EPA has been shown to relieve both forms of depression.",5442,"Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist who has conducted research on the effects of fish oil on the brain and its potential use as an antidepressant.

You can eat much faster than normal, feel uncomfortably full, eat large amounts of food even though you're not really hungry, alone because you're ashamed of how much you're eating, and then after you feel disgusted, depressed, or guilty.

They notice it, but it's not diagnosed.  And the problem is there, but it's not.  It's not been named.  It was extremely hard, but I had normalized it so much.  I, you know, like you said earlier, when you have so many people saying things to you online, I'm tough as nails, but it gets to you.  And you kind of, you, it's, I would be lying if I said that it didn't affect me.  And so when I hear people saying all you do is eat and you eat, it's like you almost believe it, even though I know I'm not.  So it was extremely isolating.  It was lonely.  And I will say that getting a diagnosis does feel wonderful, but it is extremely lonely.  It's, sometimes I...  I really fight with the shame of it, which I think is the hardest part.  But how are you dealing with regaining your voice, your message, and the intention of the message that you wanted on Instagram, which is, this is my journey, and I know I'm not alone.  How are you resetting this for you and to help other people who want to hear it?  I just take it day by day.  Like today, I tried to feed myself.  Didn't do that great.  And...  Like one of your guests said earlier, I just try to be gentle with myself.  I try to remind myself that how I'm feeling, if I'm having these bad feelings, is temporary.  And I also take...  I take immense pride in the fact that...  I understand that I was given this platform originally for modeling.  Not given.  I busted my ass.  I don't know if I can say ass.  I busted my butt.  To get here.  But I feel immense gratitude and pride that I am able to sit here with you and talk about such hard things and know that there's somebody on the other side that feels less alone.  That maybe says to themselves, I'm going to get help.  Asks for help.  Starts taking care of themselves in the way that they deserve.  Because, you know, plus size or not, we all...  Everybody deserves food.  Everybody deserves to eat.  You know?  We deserve to take care of ourselves.  And we deserve to live without judgment.  We do.  We do.  Yes.  That's the biggest thing in all of this.  Are you currently in therapy?  How often are you in treatment?  Yeah, so I see my dietician once a week.  And then I have my therapist once a week.  And...  And I have a lot of people in my life who lovingly just nudge me, nudge me along the right path.  And, yeah, I'm doing it.  You are doing it.  You're doing it.  Thank you so much, Tess.

I do suffer from bipolar disorder. There are so many pitfalls that kind of a beat me that I could fall into if I don't properly take care of my mental health. Taking care of myself for me was doing a lot of mental work, a lot of reading on mental health. I had to learn about neuroscience and psychology to kind of get a better understanding of my own brain. I also had to deal with some tragic losses very early, losing my mother at 19 and then my father after that. I was a paul bear about four times before I was 30 years old. So taking care of myself first was through the coaching mental health stuff I did through meditation, through reprogramming habits.

It accelerates results far more rapidly because it’s the best way to remove blind spots to core programming that cause continual setbacks &amp; barriers in life. 
Therapy isn’t only about overcoming trauma, it’s also a solution-focused approach for those who value investing in a better mindset and upgrading their life, rather than circling around the same problem for years, escalating it further. I didn't know how much I needed to heal until I overcame these past traumas.
“I healed ADD, PTSD, OCD, primary relationships, and other distortions through Liberated Living‘s PANACEA courses”.
Liberate ongoing generations of these burdens and address your trauma for your spouse, your kids, and particularly for yourself.
#panacea#healtrauma"," Recoding our epigenetic patterns is a game changer, particularly for those who suffer any kind of trauma, major or minor.  It accelerates results far more rapidly because it is the best way to remove the blind spots to core programming that cause continual setbacks and barriers in life.  Therapy is not only about overcoming trauma, it's also a solution-focused approach for those who value investing in a better mindset and upgrading their life.  Rather than circling around a problem for years, escalating the repercussions.  We all know that engaging in our deeper inner work is not easy, particularly while also managing a work-life balance.  However, unresolved trauma can lead to broken relationships and families, as well as addictions, anxiety, shame, unhealthy boundaries, depression, and tragically even suicide.  Therefore, passing on these same patterns to our offspring.  Both my twin and I experienced trauma.  We experienced birth trauma that resulted in chronic health conditions.  This guided us to natural approaches to get to the source of the issue.  Consequently, this led us on the career path in natural medicine as holistic practitioners and therapists because it's essential to not only practice our own medicine, but also master it.  So we cultivated a series of different modalities and discovered the solution and preeminence in holistic sciences.  What we found most appealing about holistic medicine is that it centers on the whole scope of the individual.  Mental, physical, emotional, and emotional.  To achieve complete wholeness.  Leaving nothing out and pinpointing the root cause, inspiring us to adopt an entirely holistic lifestyle.  So we started with our inherent patterns to get to the root of the matter quicker and for the long term.  When we first address our psychology, we can gain insight into the entirety of the individual because the body is not separate from our mind.  So after more than 20 years of working with clients, we discovered the common thread and found that epigenetic inheritance was absolutely necessary.  This is at the heart of everyone's challenges, ours included.  Even for those who don't know their biological parents, inherent programming is the common denominator underpinning each of our chief challenges, which is necessary to address in order to both overcome and prevent life obstacles.  A classic example of this could be a common parent-child pattern, such as repeating our parents' or grandparents' relationship patterns, which may be cycles of abandonment, and seeing these same patterns evidenced in our life, and so forth.  When we reframe our beliefs and rewire our neural circuitry, we activate the correct gene expression and effectively remove the distortions of our inherent subconscious programming for epigenomes.  In other words, we can recode our inherent programming using the correct techniques or strategies.  We all have negative patterns that we wish to improve.  Sure, some may want to make certain effort to repeat their parents' mistakes, perhaps even overcorrecting.  Yet when we tend to run away from our past and resist becoming like our parents,  or fear that we'll fail to ever live like our parents,  or fear that we'll fail to ever live like our parents,  or fear that we'll fail to ever live like our parents,  or fear that we'll fail to ever live like our parents,  we actually meet more resistance  them available on a larger scale and compress them into a shortcut system using our seven-step  panacea model and build an entirely done-for-you turnkey practice with credentials for healing  professionals as well as for those who wish to recode genetic patterns we don't have to carry  the excruciating pain of past generational trauma very far it can be channeled into fuel to empower  our individual advancement i promise it's possible to find freedom and triumph after trauma because  we did it can eliminate long held scars and pain and we'll feel more complete at peace and knowing  our innate worth with the capacity to achieve radiant happiness and fall absolutely in love  with our life i just confronted my epigenetics with this recoding system and completely altered  a different way of life establishing a newfound healthy relationship with myself and others address  your trauma for your spouse your kids and particularly for yourself to liberate ongoing  generations of these lives  there's a powerful freedom on the other side of trauma if you choose to do the transformative work  i can't think of a more powerful mission to contribute to society",346,1,0,0,0,-1,1.0,Bitchute

#freefire #motivation #new","Do you know the secret to breaking anxiety and depression? The Bible says God is giving you a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. He's not giving you fear, but he's giving you power, love, and a sound mind. So how do we get rid of that spirit? Well, the Bible told us that praise is our way to the breakthrough. We see that in Acts chapter 16. Paul and Silas are imprisoned, but at the midnight hour, they began singing hymns of praise to God. And as they did, a great earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. The doors were open and everyone's shackles were unfastened. Not only does your praise have the power to set you free, but it also has the power to set those around you free. Begin to praise the Lord today, and as you do, the shackles of depression and anxiety will break off of your life, and you'll see yourself walking in a whole new peace like you've never had before.

THANK YOU &amp; GOD BLESS!"," Hi folks, my name is Miranda. I use she, her pronouns, and I'm a licensed professional  counselor and sex therapist in Erie, Pennsylvania. And today I want to talk about minor attracted  persons. And I want to talk about minor attracted persons because they are probably the most  vilified population of folks in our culture. And most folks are making incorrect assumptions about  them without actually knowing much about them. And those assumptions create harm for an already  marginalized population. You may have noticed that I'm using the term minor attracted persons,  sometimes abbreviated to MAPS, instead of the more commonly used term pedophile. And I'm doing  this because the term pedophile has moved from being a diagnostic label to being a judgmental,  hurtful insult that we hurl at people in order to harm them or slander them. I also prefer  person first language that recognizes that any label we might apply to a person is only part  of who they are and doesn't represent everything that they are. We are all people first with many  different facets or parts of ourselves. And this includes folks who are attracted to minors.  So to start, I want to talk about minor attracted persons.  To start with, let's talk about what a minor attracted person is or who they are. This term  simply means that the person has an enduring sexual or romantic attraction to minors. They've  not chosen this attraction, just as the rest of us have not chosen whatever our attraction is. You  don't get to choose to be heterosexual or to be gay or whatever you are. And you don't get to choose  to be a minor attracted person. So let's talk about what a minor attracted person is.  Some minor attracted persons are attracted to a specific age range of minors, while some are not.  And some minor attracted persons are exclusively attracted to minors  and are not attracted to adults at all. Some minor attracted persons are also attracted to adults.",514,10,0,0,0,0,0.0,Bitchute

J9CON230745"," Here are three tips for ADHD. Number one, listen to binaural beats. In this study, it was found that parents and adolescents stated that their homework problems due to inattention improved during just a three week study listening to binaural beats. Number two, DHA and EPA. So fish oils and taking it as a supplement can be very helpful for ADHD as found in this study. And number three, avoid artificial food dyes. So things like candy and drinks that are colored with what you'll see on the label is FDNC, red, blue, or green, and then a number beside it. These are really not great for ADHD as found in the research. Follow for more ADHD tips.",17147,"3 Tips for ADHD #shorts

23,23.0,xkECQasqHzYW,My Fear Regarding Faking Disorders on TikTok,"It's a slippery slope I know, but something to think about, nonetheless. "," I was thinking about the girls who are faking disorders on TikTok.  I mentioned this in one of my videos, actually, but in case you don't know,  on TikTok, and don't try to find me on TikTok, I'm not on there,  I just watch cringe compilations, because on TikTok there are a bunch of,  a myriad of high school girls who are faking different disorders.  Mostly Tourette's and DID, it seems, but it could be anything.  The real thing that I'm actually worried about,  like these girls could totally screw up their brains, all that, that's all terrible too.  But one of the things that I was thinking about today is  a lot of these girls aren't diagnosed.  They have been diagnosing themselves, which is a problem on its own,  because they could misdiagnose themselves.  But, nowadays you can just say, with no documentation or anything whatsoever,  that you are the gender you're not.  And, to me, I wonder if it's just a,  a matter of time until people are going to be, actually,  just saying that they have these mental illnesses and being taken seriously.  Think about it, like, what's the difference between me saying,  actually, I'm a man, and me telling you, actually, I have schizophrenia.  When I don't, when I'm obviously not either of those things, but,  what's the difference?  Like, if someone, if we make it normalized for people who just say,  all of a sudden, oh, I'm non-binary, oh, I'm this, oh, I'm that,  and you just have to respect them, and,  essentially, any time they're around you, you have to curb your language,  or else you might get fired from your job, or some shit like that.  Like, what is the difference?  To me, they're both things that are factual.  You either have a mental illness, or you don't.  But how long is it going to be before we just take people's words for it?  Let everyone just self-diagnose.  And, like, how far does that go?  Will they be able to get medication for this disorder that they've diagnosed themselves with?  We don't know.  Just something to think about.",657,7,0,0,0,0,6.0,Bitchute

BPD Recovery - I'm learning to live with Borderline Personality Disorder and Anxiety and Depression.

My intended audience is people interested in mental health education, specifically aiming towards BPD, major depressive disorder, anxiety and depression, trauma, personality disorders, addiction, wellness tips, coping strategies and emotional regulation.

This channel is to show an inside perspective of living with BPD, anxiety and depression and what goes on in the mind of someone who is recovering from those mental health problems. 

I do joke about my mental health and find this helps me to deal with the very real symptoms of my mental health problems. At the same time I hope to bring some humour and comedy to others who are going through the same struggle. I'm still learning to cope and hope you enjoy and maybe relate to my take on my mental health as I go through life and mental health (bpd) recovery.

You just need to pull the trigger to the right position. But this game has a lot of ads. The crazy thing is that you have to watch an ad after playing a game. And it's only about 20% free.

We are not liars.  We call the air release. Other democratic means, they don't work. We tried voting. We tried writing  the seconds.  What is work more? Art or life? Is it work more than food? Work more than justice? Are  you more concerned about the protection of a painting, or the protection of our planet  and people? The cost of living is more important than justice. The cost of living is more important  than the cost of oil prices. Fuel is unfavorable to millions of cold, hungry families. They  can't even afford to heat a tin of soup. Meanwhile, crops are failing.  A few moments later.  I'm doing this for my son. The government's inaction on climate change is a death sentence  to us all. United Nations have said we should stop climate change. We are not liars. We  have no new oil. Livetrust wants to open 130 new oil licenses. That's a death sentence  to this planet.

I used to have anorexia. You can find the information pertaining that in my book. I've talked about it openly. And I am just so grateful that as a society, we recognize that anorexia is in fact a mental disorder, right? If you are thin and you think that you are fat, you have a mental disorder. If you are thin as I was, it was very, very thin. And you think that you need to control aspects of your life by not eating as I did, then you have something that is a mental disorder. Fortunately, when I was young, we just said, you got to fix that. It's a problem and it's wrong. Now you have kids who have mental disorders and you would have adults that would say, you know what? You shouldn't eat today if you're anorexic. You shouldn't eat for the next three weeks. Let's see how long you can go without eating because I want to affirm what you believe that you are.

It was definitely a first sign of autism that I just didn't recognize. It is one of Sawyer's stems. Sawyer would spin all day long if I would let him. This is, I believe, called a jolly jump up. He would live in this. It was his favorite thing to do. I mean Sawyer wasn't even walking yet and he was figuring out a way to spin. Sawyer would look for any opportunity to get that stem that he needed. He loved this tire swing. He would stay at the park all day and just want to do this. When Sawyer finally figured out he could spin himself, this is what he would do all day long. It was a challenge because sometimes he would run into walls or others. Most of the time he was so good at spinning he could keep himself safe. Sawyer is definitely an expert spinner. This is his favorite thing to do.",2841100,"#SpinningWithAutism

But Mal Adaptive is an excessive form of imagination where someone gets obsessed with a fantasy world, either from a game or film or book. They find a compulsion to remain in that world for several hours in a day. That soon replaces their real-life interactions. So their work is affected, relationships, personal lives. There is some overlap between Mal Adaptive and problematic internet gaming. So these are people who play games to avoid real-life difficulties. In the game, they would be winning, successful, in control, while real life is often chaotic and a struggle. People with Mal Adaptive get distressed at the thought of losing control and so they prefer to remain in that world. It can be a psychological issue and they should go for therapy.",33020,"#Shorts
Maladaptive Daydreaming or MD is a form of escapism where someone prefers remaining in a fantasy world rather than coping with real world problems.  Have you heard of this term? 
Also, DO NOT tag your gamer friends here.

."," Try this easy hack for your anxiety. Do you ever crave salty foods when you are stressed out and you're very anxious? Well that's because your brain has very specific sensors for sodium and this is going to help to maintain your homeostasis and of course the balance between your fight or flight, your sympathetic nervous system and your parasympathetic. So my tip here, just get a little bit of salt and put a pinch into your mouth, ideally under your tongue and drink that down with a little bit of water. You can do this throughout the day when you are feeling anxious to help to balance those electrolytes and maintaining your other electrolytes as well. So magnesium is going to be really important for your nervous system and other herbal medicines that I love for anxiety. So things like valerian, skull cat, passionflower and lemon balm, that combination together is amazing for chronic anxiety.
