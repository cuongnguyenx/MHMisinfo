In my own experience people suddenly care a lot when you hit rock bottom, make an attempt or become outwardly ""crazy"" when you have fell so deep you can't function and when this happens people accept that person needs some time of too rest.

What about before that point though? If a person can feel that point hardening towards them and they are trying so hard to keep themselves a float but people can't see that yet so they decide to take that time of then all of a sudden that person is lazy or a hypochondriac, unless God forbid they attempt and succeed and then suddenly ""we wish they had talked to us"" 

If we allowed people to take the time they needed to recover and rest before they hit the bottom of the ocean and need resusitating I think the world would be a much better place with a lot more people in it. 💙

You can find more information on this topic on the website www.karima.org.uk/live. The modern understanding of this issue is being discussed in the context of the Foundation of Muslim Mental Health Science. Karima is a significant organization involved in this work.","Two main reasons why it's important for the average Muslim. One is that I think we need to get away from this stigma of mental health being something that is reserved just for people who have problems. And we really need to, as a community, embrace that everybody needs to do work on themselves. And that we're all works in progress and it's just a continuum. It's not necessarily those people who have mental health issues and then the normal people, but there's a spectrum in between and we need to embrace this idea of looking at ourselves and doing work on ourselves. The second reason is from the study of Islamic psychology or understanding Islam through the lens of psychology, what I find that it does for people is that it really gives them a deeper insight into Islam, the religion of Islam as a path for living life as a human being."

What I’m not an advocate for though is people labeling themselves as their mental issues. Some people like myself have a mental illness, but I am not my mental illness I am Levi. That doesn’t mean at times I’ve fallen in the trap of believing I am my mental illness because I have at times. But God reminds me I am Levi Mack. Not a label. 

Lastly, yesterday I attended my friend’s funeral who recently passed away. Unfortunately I didn’t get to share this message there (I was trying to time when I’d speak and I just send it when I could’ve). But the message was from one of the last conversations Sabian and I had. He wanted to help people who resonated with his struggles one day. With that being said I am passing the message onto myself and many of you to help others who are suffering or not speaking on their difficulties. Reach out to someone you know has a tough situation right now. It could save a life.

Apathy is one those mental states that can be very debilitating. You really don't care about anything. Apathy can be defined as reduced motivation engaging in goal-directed activities across three domains. Initiative, interest, and emotional responsiveness. You can become apathetic as a result depression, schizophrenia, neurologic disorders, like stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and dementias Alzheimer's. Another thing that cause apathy is antidepressant medication. But the full experience also involves just being in this place existing. You're not motivated to do anything. And more than that, you don't care whether or not do something. And even though this sounds like it could be a nice, relaxed, low-key state, it's not.

The natural urge is to stay in bed, cancel your plans, just hide away from the world. But the longer you stay ruminating, thinking over and over, the things that make you feel depressed, the more time you spend stuck and make your mood even worse.
So let's say you wake up in the morning and you just don't feel good. So you decide to do that, phew I don't have to face the world today.
But the problem is, is that it's addictive. Because as soon as you decide to do that, the world today, the things hidden for you that you should have confronted, stay hidden.

Occasional use of cannabis products like weed will cause a lot of people to be calm and relax. Chronic use can have the opposite effect, and what happens is that over time, if you use it a lot and for many months or years, you get what's called a regulation of the cannabinoid receptors in your brain. It no longer is effective. You can think of it sort of like a tolerance to weed. You know, this will depend upon your own personal genetics, also what kind of cannabis you're using, and how often and much you partake. Follow us for more addiction and recovery information."

And a lot of the times I ended up forgetting who I was, I definitely lost grip on reality and it triggered my psychosis.

Now day dreaming is normal. We spend almost 30% of our waking hours dreaming. But Mal Adaptive is an excessive form of imagination where someone gets obsessed with a fantasy world, either from a game or film or book. They find a compulsion to remain in that world for several hours in a day. That soon replaces their real-life interactions. So their work is affected, relationships, personal lives. There is some overlap between Mal Adaptive and problematic internet gaming. So these are people who play games to avoid real-life difficulties. In the game, they would be winning, successful, in control, while real life is often chaotic and a struggle. People with Mal Adaptive get distressed at the thought of losing control and so they prefer to remain in that world. It can be a psychological issue and they should go for therapy."

He can be found on social media platforms such as @patmartinlcsw and @thementalhealthtoolbox. His expertise lies in active listening, a crucial skill when engaging with individuals in need. When supporting someone, it is essential to ask what they need and provide a silent presence when required. Additionally, Patrick emphasizes the importance of linking them to appropriate resources to ensure their well-being.","Hi, are you trying to figure out how to support a friend who is hurting? Well, in this quick video, I'm going to give you five tips to get you started. Tip number one, let them lead the conversation. two, practice active listening. That's why we have ears and one mouth. three, ask. what kind of help they need. four, be silent. this is also known as the sitting Shiva. in some cultures, when people are grieving, they just want someone to sit with them, sometimes for a week, two weeks, just to quiet and keep them company without having to talk about the problem. five, offer to link them to other support systems and resources. you could even offer to do some research with them because oftentimes when you're feeling depressed or anxious, it's hard to do things on your own. So just be that support for them and help them do some of the groundwork. Okay? Hopefully that was helpful. be well. keep thriving. bye-bye."

Mental health is really the logical stuff. When we talk about emotional, that's the side of ourselves, being able to acknowledge what we feel, validate it, and soothe it. The aspect of what it is that you're experiencing is the ability to use logic to decide how do you actually want to feel. So this is where we tap into free will. We all have the ability in every moment to decide where we want to put our focus and our energy and our attention. That's free will and that's mental health. Being able to take responsibility for yourself to say I'm going to decide, choose to focus on this rather than going down the rabbit hole."

ADHD is also a prevalent disorder that can lead to mood swings. Understanding the symptoms and treatment options for mood disorders and ADHD can help individuals and healthcare professionals provide appropriate support.","Hey, what's the difference between mood disorders and ADHD swings? Why don't you ask them yourself? What's up? Sweet, okay, how are you guys triggered? I'm actually not by life events, I just kind of come out of the blue and I'm usually a response to something happening in a person's life. Oh, plus I match the person's perception of that trigger. good point, I don't do that. I am completely separate from what's happening in someone's life. Well, that's to know. How long do you last, by the way? weeks or months, unless treated, of course. I go away pretty quickly. Usually gone once the person engages in something new or interesting. So mood disorders are not by life events, have a slow onset and last for a long period of time, whereas ADHD and mood swings are a response to life event, shift very quickly and last for a very short period of time. Yeah, you got it."

The first sign is extreme mood swings, going from mania to depression. These swings can be accompanied by feeling like you are more important or capable than you really are, also known as grandiosity. Another sign is having trouble with sleep, either sleeping too much or not being able to sleep at all. Impulsive decisions, such as spending too much money or engaging in risky activities, are common symptoms. Feeling very energetic or very tired is another indicator.

While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. 

If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.

People with GAD worry about normal things like money, healthy, relationships, and jobs. 

It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. 

However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. 

People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else.

The Bible says God is giving you a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. He's not giving you fear, but he's giving you power, love, and a sound mind. So how do we get rid of that spirit? Well, the Bible told us that praise is our way to the breakthrough. We see that in Acts chapter 16. Paul and Silas are imprisoned, but at the midnight hour, they began singing hymns of praise to God. And as they did, a great earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. The doors were open and everyone's shackles were unfastened. Not only does your praise have the power to set you free, but it also has the power to set those around you free.

The results showed that negative effect was associated with increased rumination, while positive was adaptive coping. Furthermore, extreme cognitive appraisals were found to strengthen these relationships. This suggests that feedback loops exist between effective states and coping behaviors in the daily lives of individuals with bipolar disorder.

It gets sort of 98 to 99% of my schizophrenia episodes. Those videos that I share where I'm on my couch talking to myself having a schizophrenia episode, if I didn't take the medicine that I take, it would just be all that the time. But because all that medicine, I'm really just having it on the couch, and really doesn't happen. I mean, I'm not sharing like, 500-400 videos a day. Like, it would be if wasn't on medicine, but only like, you know, one or two videos. Maybe, get like, a day or something like that. I don't know what trying say anymore.

Happy Friday! Just wondering with how your brain works, what is the one thing that no matter how simple you think you're explaining it, you always tend to over explain things. Because of the group of people you work with or the friends you seem like you're explaining it's simple. However, whenever you explain some regular person on the street it seems like they tell you to simplify when you don't know how to make it more simple. A prime example for me is whenever I try to explain anything I do to fix a computer. I think I dumb it down a lot however most other people don't. Alright guys, just let me know what's the thing that you think you over explain when you and your brain are thinking you can't make this any simpler. Let me know."

I was in it and just starting comedy. So I'm doing stand-up. I have a routine of like a beer and a shot to edge the nerves. Now revisiting comedy, sober, trying to get on stage, dealing with the emotions before that, all the negative stuff happening to me at work. Right? Downward spot. And then I deploy. I essentially throw everything onto my wife. We've got two kids, dogs, cats. She's stressed the hell out. It's a very low point. Now being two years removed from it, it's getting easier.

These substances, known as antidepressants, have various effects on different organs of the body. Some of these antidepressants can increase serotonin levels, which can be very beneficial for people. However, high doses of these medications can lead to challenges such as sexual side effects, blunted appetite, or decreased motivation. It is important to note that serotonin binds to receptors, which plays a significant role in its effects. Understanding these levels, whether they are low or high, gives us insight into a very important aspect of neuroscience history. Even though some of the antidepressants have unwanted side effects, the discovery of their effects on the body's organs is a critical part of neuroscience advancement.","These neuromodulators can exist in normal levels, low, high, and that actually gives us a window into a very important aspect of neuroscience history, which is the discovery of antidepressants.

And it is a low progesterone level. So a lot of women don't realize that their hormones have a lot to do with how they're feeling mentally. So if you've been having a lot of anxiety, even depression, this can be because your progesterone is quite low. But don't worry, I've got some natural tips how to raise your progesterone naturally without the need of hormones. My number one tip is to get more natural sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is very much linked to healthy progesterone levels. Another thing you can do is increase your vitamin C intake. And of course, not from a synthetic ascorbic acid type of vitamin C supplement, more vitamin C foods. So things like peppers are great, whether that is the fresh, red, and green peppers. But if you like the spicy peppers, this will help with your vitamin C as well. Or take a whole food vitamin C supplement. Follow for more natural health tips."

Depression is an emotional state. Major depressive disorder is an illness. As humans, we're reactive, but not every negative reaction is an illness. There's another mental disorder called adjustment reaction with depressed mood. Some people call it situational depression. It's a milder form of the depressive illness that's triggered by a trauma or a stressor. This disorder is defined as having marked distress that's out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor and significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Degree of impairment is generally how we determine the severity of an illness and what kind of treatment you should pursue, if any. With impairment, we look at the degree of problems that it's causing in your day-to-day life in three main realms. Social, occupational, and personal functioning."

This is something that's not just in humans. Even animals can become highly depressed. This is what is causing depression, like deep, deep depression, because people are found themselves in this cage. They've lost meaning. They've lost their connection to God. The liberal system is constantly attacking God and religion. And God and religion is important for people's psychology. God and religion is important for people to live happy, fulfilled lives. That's a central need that people have. And liberalism destroys it. Liberalism is the one that destroys it, is violating people's fundamental human interests, and therefore their fundamental human rights.

I often hear and see that EFPs get diagnosed with ADHD or ADD. I think this is actually incorrect and is simply due to their personality. But oftentimes, mental health professionals don't care about this and just want to stuff them full of drugs, permanently changing their brain chemistry. So I find that EFPs lean into this belief as well, seeing they're so emotionally driven and also due to TI trickster. I had this one EFP I knew and he would get very, very aggressive after not taking his medication for a short period. And after people confronted him and said he had to chill out or he couldn't do that, he would say, well, I have ADHD or I haven't taken my medication yet so you can't blame me. Clearly, there needs to be a better solution than to just put your child in a vegetative drugged state. And I would say that's proper understanding of typology."

Chat with me 👋 https://calendly.com/coreyboardman/30min

Hi, I'm Corey. I am a writer/actor/comedian based in Los Angeles. I have dealt with mental health issues since the fifth grade. Now I want to laugh with them. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. I'm not a doctor, but that’s exactly why my brother said I should talk about it. 

This is a literal self help channel. For me, and hopefully for you. 🙌

I feel like ever since I stayed at home and I no longer go to a job to work, I feel like I'm a work from home mom because I do YouTube videos as well. So I would consider myself a work from home mom, but ever since I don't go to work anymore, I feel like I lost a little person part of my personality. Like I feel like I used to be so outgoing before I used to talk to people. I'm always so happy and energetic. And ever since I'm at home and I just talked to the kids and no one else, I feel like I lost that part of me. Definitely leave me a comment down below. Let me know if you guys have felt the same way ever since you stay at home with your children."

At least what my beliefs are is that if you have schizophrenia That means that you're really just extremely Extremely sensitive to the spirit world. People with schizophrenia will claim seeing different entities within people or outside of people talking and Communicating with one another. They'll even hear some of the entities speaking directly to them. People will try to claim that they're hallucinations and illusions I do not think that's the case. Mainly because of a chemical compound within the human brain known as dimethyltryptomy There was a study where scientists studied the urine of people who had schizophrenia They found out that 47% of them had dimethyltryptomy and also known as DMT within their urine Dimethyltryptomy is a very powerful psychedelic that allows you to see certain entities. People claim that hallucinations. I truly do not believe that is the case I believe that they're really entities. If you've ever come out of a deep sleep and saw some sort of Hallucination of some sort of entity that was caused by the DMT in your brain And many very spiritual cultures from around the world also believe that schizophrenia are very spiritually sensitive"

What? A study in 2018 evaluated 132,000 women and children and followed them for three to eleven years and found that women who during pregnancy took Tylenol for a prolonged amount of time had an increased risk of 20% of autism in their children and 30% increased risk of ADHD. Another study showed that taking Tylenol less than eight days did not have those effects. What is a mama to do? If you're having fever or chronic pain, you need to talk to your doctor, naturopath, chiropractor about natural remedies to reduce fever and pain. Having fever during pregnancy can also be detrimental, so we must weigh our benefits and risks. Tylenol may be necessary, but let's evaluate some natural remedies first."

Well, not from a clinical point of view, but just from an experiential point of view. Being depressed, discouraged, disheartened, pessimistic. Why? I think today, more than in past generations, it's coming from confusion. When you're not sure, it's hard to be happy. Even when things are good, but I'm not sure why things are what they are. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I should put up with any of this. I don't know, and that's depressing. Even if things are good. So it's not problems that depress us. It's the pointlessness. Something happens, no matter how painful it is. We won't get depressed if we can see some sense, some rhyme and reason.

So if you're suffering with panic attacks, anxiety, I want you to do this. I took Lucy's head off of Lucy. Now all you're gonna do is dunk your face into some ice water. Dunk, hold your breath for as long as possible. Come up for a breath. You gotta do this three times. Go back in for as long as you can. Hold your breath, come up for a breath. And again, your third dunk. You will feel fantastic. No more anxiety helps to work with your vagus nerve and put you into that more relaxed state, parasympathetic.

I’m not a doctor. #shorts,"If you think you might have ADHD, be sure to get an official diagnosis from a trained physician or therapist. Also, you might consider meditation (with a T) which I've been using for decades to manage my ADHD.

If you have wondered that or if you struggle with the ability to focus, you might be like me, somebody who has ADHD and I've got a little test you can do that helps you understand whether or not you actually have ADHD. Now, I am not a trained therapist, I'm not a doctor, I'm just somebody who struggled with ADHD all my life. And so this is something that is just an indicator. If you feel like you do have ADHD and want to get tested and go to a professional, I'm not one. So here is the test. I want you to focus on this green dot, 100% of your focus on the green dot. Okay, if you glanced at the red dot, that might be an indicator that you have ADHD. If you're real focused, you stayed on the green dot. If you struggle with ADHD or struggle with focus, you might have glanced at the red dot. That's just an indicator. So do check it out with a professional when you get the chance. My name is Jamie Turner. These are the unspoken rules of leadership. I hope that was helpful for you."

I had an eating disorder and God healed me of an eating disorder. I had problems with incredible rage, not just the anger, rage and wrath. And God healed me from that. So whatever the cross is intersectional or your life has been is what you take out and give testimony to the power of the cross in your life. This was the resurrection power of Christ in my life. You know, only eternity will reveal the brilliance of the cross. I believe that the cross was actually how God defeated the enemy. It says that He put to death the enmity between heaven and earth with the cross."

Dr. Janine suggests trying this easy hack for your anxiety.  She explains how some people crave salty foods when they are stressed.  This is because the brain has sensors for sodium that help to maintain homeostasis.  Dr. Janine recommends putting a little pinch of salt in your water or directly under your tongue when having a stressful moment or panic attack.  You can also try drinking an electrolyte drink, Dr. Janine has a great recipe for one you can make at home.  Dr. Janine also suggests some herbal medicines that are great at relieving anxiety.

Do you ever crave salty foods when you are stressed out and you're very anxious? Well that's because your brain has very specific sensors for sodium and this is going to help to maintain your homeostasis and of course the balance between your fight or flight, your sympathetic nervous system and your parasympathetic. So my tip here, just get a little bit of salt and put a pinch into your mouth, ideally under your tongue and drink that down with a little bit of water. You can do this throughout the day when you are feeling anxious to help to balance those electrolytes and maintaining your other electrolytes as well. So magnesium is going to be really important for your nervous system and other herbal medicines that I love for anxiety. So things like valerian, skull cat, passionflower and lemon balm, that combination together is amazing for chronic anxiety. Follow for more natural health tips."

So psychologists did a study and determined that every Disney princess has some type of clear disorder. For instance, you know Ariel from The Little Mermaid? Well, you remember all of the thousands of things she collected over the years. That's hoarding and it's a clear sign of OCD. As for this next one, well, you know in Alice in Wonderland she sees talking cats, caterpillars, bunny rabbits, at tea parties and just a whole bunch of psychedelic stuff. Yeah, this is classed as a form of schizophrenia. People who have this disorder even say that they have seen similar things to what is shown in the Alice in Wonderland movie. Weird. But before we continue, which Disney character do you relate to the most? Let me know in the comment section below. So Belle from Beauty and the Beast. She gets captured by a beast and held captive in his castle, but then soon tries to see the good in him. And then she later falls in love with him? That's Stockholm Syndrome. That is where a victim falls in love with their captor. This cannot be a coincidence. So."

If they say that's discrimination, they're overly applying their own label. Well, I think when you say they're mentally ill, like that, well, give some face to it. I have said, and I will continue to maintain, the gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder, whichever DSM you choose to use, is a mental illness. Mm-hmm. That is... And that... And again, and again. God forbid that it should be said with any animus, because this is not said with animus. When people are suffering, these are clearly folks who are suffering. When people are suffering, you shouldn't be saying stuff with animus. I'm not saying that as a got you to people who are transgender. The point that I'm making is that when a society begins treating folks who have mental illness as though they are representing an objective reality, they are doing no service to the people who actually suffer from a mental illness. My grandfather suffered from schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia. He was institutionalized. If the doctors had said to him, Nate, you're fine. We believe that the radio is actually talking to you. That is not a service to him. That would have been terrible for him. Right? They put him in an institution, they gave him lithium and it helped."

WHO AM I:
I'm a clinical psychologist. I am here to share insights from therapy and psychology research so that you can make use of it in your daily life to understand how your mind works and optimise your own mental health. I cover all things from confidence and motivation to mood and anxiety. I look forward to chatting with you in the comments.",27,1814558,1476.0,143505.0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiHAnwJo69g/hqdefault.jpg,,2023-12-16 23:37:39,https://youtube.com/shorts/iiHAnwJo69g,0,0,1,0,"['G', 'as happy and healthy.', 'to work or school every day', 'some work and some support.']"," So what is high-functioning depression? Now, depression doesn't start the day you can't get out of bed. In reality, very few people suddenly become debilitated by depression. Mostly that builds up over years of struggling to keep your head above the water while meeting all of life's expectations at the same time. So you can be deeply suffering with the symptoms of depression, even though you're still getting by doing everything that you're supposed to do. That's why it's called high-functioning depression. And because outwardly, everyone can see how well you're coping with life. So it can be even harder to tell anyone because you feel this deep shame and you can't imagine how anyone would even believe you. So your suffering stays silent. But high-functioning is not the same as happy and healthy. The term high-functioning is not a clinical diagnosis, but depression is. And the fact that you can make it to work or school every day does not mean that your mental health couldn't benefit from some work and some support."

The quick answer is yes. When you're feeling anxious, your body is in the fight-or-flight mode of the autonomic nervous system, as if you were being attacked by a tiger. Hypnosis and hypnotic trance will bring you to its opposite, the rest and digest response, bringing you relief. Secondly, when you get triggered, even if there's no threat around you, the subconscious mind is registering a threat from the past. Using hypnotic regression, you can go in your mind to that incident in the past, see what's happening and resolve it where it lives for a long-term fix."

So that's really promising as a natural herbal medicine to help with that anxiety relief.

The end result is poor ability to regulate your mood and too much time ruminating on negative things. Here's where mindfulness comes to the rescue. Because mindfulness helps reduce the self-critical thoughts, it strengthens the connectivity in the frontal parietal network and weakens the connectivity in the default mode network. Researchers have shown that not only does the practice of mindfulness help during the period that you're doing it, but if you practice it on a regular basis, you get sustained connectivity and therefore improvement in your depression."

“People stand to profit handsomely from this experimental medicalization—puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, body-altering surgeries … all in pursuit of a lie,” says Brandon Showalter.

Showalter and Jeff Myers are co-authors of “Exposing the Gender Lie: How to Protect Children and Teens From the Transgender Industry’s False Ideology.”

“It’s an ideology that came out of the postmodern movement from the 1980s that is attempting to gain power by confusing people about the nature of reality. And then there’s an industry, medically, that comes along and … they stand to make tens of billions of dollars,” says Myers.

The NIH is funding a study on cross-sex hormones for children as young as 8 years old, according to a document released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Dr. Michael Laidlaw.

The document shows the lower age limit was lowered from 13 years old to 8 years old.

“The U.S. government has no business funding this kind of experimental research, especially on children,” says Showalter, a senior investigative reporter at The Christian Post.

These people who are dealing with these struggles, not just autism, social anxiety, depression, other psychiatric ailments and disorders, they're all very vulnerable to this.

One, it's very hard to take your focus off whatever it is that's upsetting you. And if you don't know what's upsetting you, you know, pure anxiety, but you don't know why, it's very hard to take your mind off of the feelings of anxiety. In those states of mind, it feels as if the state that you're in will go on forever. Now, when we're in happy, relaxed states, rarely do we think, gosh, this is gonna go on forever. And yet, when we are in these unfortunate states of mind, we get the idea somehow, we sort of hijacks our perception of time, and we feel like this is never going to stop. If we turn to the body and certain behaviors, we are able to move ourselves along the autonomic continuum. And at that point, when we've done that successfully, and it's actually quite straightforward to do, we are able to think about things differently. We start to get a sense that the way we feel might not be the way we're gonna feel forever. And it's in those shifts that we start to realize, ah, my mind actually is not my best friend at these extremes, but there's a lot more to it. You're only getting the tip of the iceberg in those states."

But you can't just bully the voices because they're going to bully you back. It doesn't work that way. You can't just say, oh, shoot, fly, don't bother me. No, it doesn't go away. You can't just swatter it and it's gone. And it's not how it works. I wish it was, but it's not how it works."

I used to have anorexia. You can find the information pertaining that in my book. I've talked about it openly. And I am just so grateful that as a society, we recognize that anorexia is in fact a mental disorder, right? If you are thin and you think that you are fat, you have a mental disorder. If you are thin as I was, it was very, very thin. And you think that you need to control aspects of your life by not eating as I did, then you have something that is a mental disorder. Fortunately, when I was young, we just said, you got to fix that. It's a problem and it's wrong. Now you have kids who have mental disorders and you would have adults that would say, you know what? You shouldn't eat today if you're anorexic. You shouldn't eat for the next three weeks. Let's see how long you can go without eating because I want to affirm what you believe that you are.

I don't want that for you. I want you to be happy and to enjoy your life. So I'm going to share my number one best remedy for anxiety. And this was a little bit tough but not really because I could have gone with so many of my favorite herbal medicines for anxiety. Things like ashwagandha, other herbs like passionflower, valerian are great too. But my number one best remedy for anxiety is magnesium. Why? Because most people are magnesium deficient. It's something that's simple to supplement with. My favorite type, which I always get this question, is magnesium bisglycin. It really helps with the nervous system, helps to relax the entire nervous system, your musculature as well. Follow for more natural health tips."

I record schizophrenia psychosis episodes on a security camera that I have set up in my apartment. I do this to show people that schizophrenia episodes are often non-violent. I am seriously on my couch talking to myself. Not hurting anyone and not being dangerous. I might make angry faces….but I am still only sitting on my couch.

I created the company Schizophrenic.NYC Mental Health Clothing And Lifestyle Brand in 2016 to fight stigma and get people talking about mental health. It worked. People have become more and more open about mental health and the term ‘schizophrenic’ pretty much got destigmatised in the advocacy world and extended beyond.

I’m glad you viewed this video or follow me. I’m glad you read till this far.

It's been going on for months. How do you get your medication? The first one, think about switching the dosage. You should speak to your physician. Find a dosage that is not in shortage right now and see if they can switch you to that. The second thing that you should do is really go in person. Call pharmacies and ask them if they have your medication and it's something that's involved in the shortage. They're just gonna say no. If you're in person and you have a relationship with that pharmacist and then go ahead and ask. Strategy number three, think about switching one alternative that is great is the Adderall to Vibran switch. If that's something you can afford to do, I highly recommend doing it."

Women tend to experience depression in a much more environmental sense, meaning they are directly affected by their environment. If they're unhappy, I think that makes them depressed. Men experience depression when there's no way out of that environment. I think that we are perfectly okay with going through something, but if we don't see a way out, because of all the progress that women have made, we've had to tilt the scales so you guys have a greater advantage in pretty much every aspect of life. And men just don't see that light at the end of the tunnel. That's why we just kill ourselves. That's why the common thing is like, well, yeah, men are more likely to kill themselves, but women are more likely to attempt it. Okay, well, why would that be? Because women are like, I'm upset, I'm in a man, and men are just like, yeah, I'm not going to get out of this, and they blow their head off or something. I think that speaks to the differences in our natural predispositions as men and as women, and I think that we need to acknowledge that for what it is and restore what would be considered a more traditional set of gender roles in society."

I need help. Because at the altar, God will exchange out your anger for peace. And the altar is a place of exchange. If you're going to be angry, be angry in front of the altar. If you're depressed, you better be in front of the altar when you're depressed. Then you can tell God I'm depressed, Lord. And in the God of the altar, who will change your depression for joy. Because an altar is a place of exchange. When me and my wife are perplexed about something we don't know what to do. Or sometimes we don't see eye to eye. You know how we resolve our marriage problems? We go to the altar. Because we're not the altar. It's like I left my house. I went to another country. That's what the altar does. It's like going to another country. Yet it's your house. But you behave differently in the altar than in any other room in the house. Because even you know it belongs to the Lord."

Anxiety is so much more and it impacts your life in so many ways. You could be constantly having a lot of behavioral effects and not even know it’s because of anxiety. Your gut has a direct relation with your brain. If your brain isn’t doing well there is a big chance that it will impact your gut health as well. You could experience indigestion, heartburn, bloating, acid reflux, and diarrhea. Anxiety also affects your memory, heart rate, skin and hair health, sleep cycle, etc. In order to achieve optimum health, you need to make sure you are both physically and mentally healthy. Deep breathing, listening to music, getting physical activity, meditation, etc are some of the ways with which you can calm yourself down. However, if none of these work and your anxiety starts impacting your day-to-day life then it is time to consult a professional.

Try inhaling slowly through your nose for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this process several times until you feel more grounded and centered.

2. Engage your senses: Focusing on your senses can help you stay present and connected to your environment. Try to identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present moment and reduce feelings of anxiety.

3. Guided Imagery: This technique involves imagining a peaceful and calming scene in your mind, such as a beach or a forest. You can listen to guided imagery audio recordings that can help you visualize the scene and become fully immersed in it. This can help reduce anxiety by providing a mental escape from stressful thoughts and situations.

Remember to be patient with yourself as you practice grounding techniques. It may take some time and practice to find what works best for you, but with consistency and perseverance, you can learn to manage your anxiety and feel more grounded and centered in your everyday life.

This is not a medical advice. Do consult a qualified therapist if you have severe issues managing your anxiety.

People tell me I'm very charming and charismatic to talk to. I think this is because I feel no nervousness and therefore there's no barrier between me and them. I allow people to be themselves and then I just mirror what they are. Sociopaths are generally very good at job interviews because we lack the nervousness that regular people have. Plus we'll say anything to get the job. Our rosymeys may be creative. I may or may not speak 6 languages including Swahili and I'm a professional stop woman according to my resume.

If you come to really understand the truth revealed within this powerful Scripture, that truth will free you from the grip of fear. But this must be more than just something that you acknowledge or understand in your natural mind. This is a truth you have to receive in your spirit. Here's the verse, Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee. The key to peace is focus on and trust in God. As simple as that might sound, it's not always easy to do. When you focus on your troubles, you inspire fear. When you focus on Jesus, you inspire faith. Now, this doesn't mean that you should just ignore life's troubles. This just means that you should keep life's troubles in perspective by looking at God's ability. Fear asks what if faith boldly declares even if."

Welcome back. Yes, we're talking about hand flapping and autism, where we talk about flappy hands and stimming. So stimming stands for self-stimulatory behavior, a repetitive soothing notion that people in the autism spectrum do to feel calm when they're overly excited. Now, excitement and anxiety are the same feeling, but this is a big but. I did a video that went viral on TikTok and Instagram about how when I was in supermarkets and toy stores and stuff like that, the light flicker that I can see because the autistic brain allows for you, as an autistic person, to see the light flicker, right? The light flicker. And then you put your hand there and do this. What happens is you're counteracting that cross phase so that the wave phase is going this way for light and your hands are doing the exact opposite, which cancels out the flicker of the light. So when autistic people are doing this in front of light, what they're actually doing is creating a constant light which is more soothing and less triggering."

If a person is burned out but not depressed, they don't need to be treated with antidepressant medication. The way to address the burnout is to address the factors that led to the burnout. The way to reduce burnout is to change the individual or to change the environment. And you don't have a lot of control over your environment unless you're self-employed. So then the focus becomes learning the different ways to cope with the work setting."

Number five, you do everything the world asks of you. So no one would ever know, but most days you feel empty inside. Number four, you work hard but never really feel energized or enthusiastic. Where you used to find pleasure, now you're just going through the motions. Number three, you find yourself scrolling on social, watching hours of TV and eating junk food to numb those feelings. And number two, social events can feel more like hard work than fun because it takes so much effort to keep up the appearance of being happy.

I don't want to hear any of this bullshit that it takes years and thousands of dollars in therapy and dozens of pills to cure your depression. No, right now, stop hanging out with your loser friends, start eating healthier, go to the gym and write your fucking goals down. You need some direction in your life so that you have a purpose and know what you're actively working towards. Any of this, oh I have chemical depression stuff, is all complete bullshit. Get rid of that from your head. You're depressed because of your circumstances, not because of this mental disease. Start improving yourself and putting yourself in a better situation and you'll feel better."

Because one of the key methods that you use to, for example, defeat depression, if you're trying to have therapy, is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is where you have a chain of thoughts and it leads to a depressive outcome. And so the therapist is supposed to sit there and say, well, is that really reasonable? Should you really go all the way there? Right, exactly. Is that feeling justified? And that's a question you're never allowed to ask in today's politics. Is that feeling justified?"

Knowing what we now know about dopamine and the fact that having enough dopamine is required in order to coordinate these neural circuits that allow for focus and quality decision making. Equally valid idea is that these children and these adults are actually trying to self medicate by pursuing these compounds. Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine. Well, what happens was when somebody with ADHD takes that drug, it turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus. Their ability to focus on things other than things they absolutely care intensely about goes up. Likewise, children who consume anything that increases their levels of dopamine, if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer. They tend to be able to focus more."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention.

Boys are nearly 5 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability that often presents with challenges before the age of 3 and lasts throughout a person's lifetime. There is currently no medical detection blood test or cure for autism spectrum disorder. Being non-verbal at age 4 does not mean that a child with autism will never speak. Hyperlexia, the ability to read above one's age or grade level in school, commonly accompanies autism spectrum disorder. There is no cure for ASD, but there are several interventions that can help children learn important skills that improve everyday life."

Many of those nasty messages that we absorb sometimes come out when we get triggered, when we get angry, when we feel demeaned, when we feel unseen. And I need to remind myself that other people also have their story inside them. And when I get triggered by somebody's behavior, it's about my story. Right? And I want to remind myself that they have their story. It's very hard because it's like doing a dance with one another. Because often we cannot dance without stepping on one another's toes."

It's the fear factor. It's the being concerned of being judged and all of those things. But what I will say is people who care about you care about you through thick and thin. If you aren't doing well, let somebody know. Speak to your closest friend. Speak to a family member who you have a good, solid, positive relationship with. Find someone who you love and trust, who is supportive and non-judgmental and just tell them you're going through a rough time and see where the conversation goes. Because it's that first time of opening your mouth and saying, I'm not coping. That's the hardest. And when those words finally come out of your mouth to somebody else and you are seen and valued and supported, then you'll begin to find the strength that you need to be able to take the next steps."

So someone asked me, how do we control performance anxiety or exam stress? So I'm going to share a tip with you that worked for me. So when we have an anxiety, it's about the future, right? But the only thing that we have is this present moment right here, right now. So instead of thinking about the outcome, which is out of our control and the future is out of our control, let's focus on the present moment because the present moment is the only moment that exists and it's under our control. So by focusing on this moment and the efforts that we put in for the exam or other event, then we are actually ensuring our success. So let's focus on the present moment and the process and our effort so that we can have a beautiful result and beautiful future. If your mind does take you to these scary scenarios in the future, then just bring it back to the present moment and remind it that we have to focus on here and now. This is the only thing under our control and this is the secret of success."

Hi, I'm Corey. I am a writer/actor/comedian based in Los Angeles. I have dealt with mental health issues since the fifth grade. Now I want to laugh with them. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. I'm not a doctor, but that’s exactly why my brother said I should talk about it. 

This is a literal self help channel. For me, and hopefully for you. 🙌

I do suffer from bipolar disorder. There are so many pitfalls that kind of a beat me that I could fall into if I don't properly take care of my mental health. Taking care of myself for me was doing a lot of mental work, a lot of reading on mental health. I had to learn about neuroscience and psychology to kind of get a better understanding of my own brain. I also had to deal with some tragic losses very early, losing my mother at 19 and then my father after that. I was a paul bear about four times before I was 30 years old. So taking care of myself first was through the coaching mental health stuff I did through meditation, through reprogramming habits. That's how I focused on me in that time, which made me better at everything else."

He found that it calmed patients experiencing mania and lifted the spirits of those experiencing melancholia (depression). We now know those waters contained high levels of Lithium.

No. Does that mean that it's dumb for me to suggest that it might be possible? No. Frankly, it's kind of childish to assume that every single thing that doesn't work for you or that would not work for you because you know yourself best is a bad idea. You're actually kind of scaring people away from trying things that may work for them because you're saying, well, this isn't ADHD friendly. Why? Because it doesn't work for you. Honestly, if you hear something and it doesn't work for you but it's coming from an ADHD or and it did work for them, let it go. Find something that works for you instead. Don't downplay other options just because to you it sounds stupid or because it wouldn't work for you personally. If you've met someone with ADHD, you've met one person with ADHD."

From a fellow ADHDite, ADHDin? I have ADHD. So having ADHD doesn't mean that you can't pay attention. It means that you want to pay attention to everything. In women, the hyperactivity is much more mental than it is physical. So my brain is constantly going a million miles an hour and that's often reflected in how quickly I can speak. It also doesn't mean that you're a bad student. I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA and I graduated college Magnum Cum Laude. I can do work very quickly but I often make careless mistakes so I would turn in an assignment but I'd forget to put my name on it. I'm terrible at responding to texts and emails because in my mind every message is a new task and it becomes very overwhelming very quickly. I really don't like watching movies but I can binge watch a TV show because there's built-in breaks between episodes. I'm always interrupting people when they're talking to me because they'll say something and that will make me think of something and I want to say it to them before I forget. I constantly have music and phrases stuck in my head. It is never quiet in my brain."

In other words, are you really depressed if you can feel good for part of the day? Usually we think of someone who is moderately too severely depressed as being very sad and unresponsive to things, but that isn't always how it looks. But when it does look like this, we call it having melancholic features or a melancholic depression. When someone is able to have a good day or enjoy some things, we call it having atypical features or an atypical depression. With atypical depression, you can brighten up when something good happens. It is a momentary brightening though, and it's not something that you feel for weeks, but you can feel like your mood has lifted usually in response to a positive event, like a party or watching a good movie. With melancholic depression, you don't have much positive response when good things happen. You just feel really low and it just seems like nothing can lift you up."

While there is some evidence to suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish oil, can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression, the research is not yet conclusive.

One of the key ways that fish oil may help with depression is by reducing inflammation in the brain. Inflammation has been linked to a range of mental health conditions, including depression, and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.

This is nutrition, but it's profoundly affecting mood and depression is terrible, right? Depression can have a component of anxiety in some cases where people are, they feel lousy and very uncertain. That's kind of how I talk about depression with anxiety is you know, you talk to someone who's anxious and you can tell them everything's gonna be okay, okay? And they're always concerned about what might, they might not know. You don't really know the plane isn't gonna crash. You don't really know that life is gonna go okay. And in some sense, they're right. No one has a crystal ball or can predict the future, but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty. And then of course there are the versions of depression that involve certainty. People are lethargic and they're certain they say, I'm certain I'm never gonna get another job. I'm certain I'm never gonna meet anyone new. I'm certain I'm gonna fail. There's this divide in the sphere of depression around certainty and uncertainty. But what's interesting is this 1000 milligrams per day where more of EPA has been shown to relieve both forms of depression."

When you sow down and every day you wake up, even if it's sunshine, it's grey and you're negative all the time. And you're infectious, you infect people who are around you, make them negative and down. And you push everybody away, you just want to be left alone, like in the dark corner, and left alone. If you had your arm chopped off, and people could see you, and they know you've got a proper injury, but with you being mentally unwell, you can't see someone's brain. So I could be here now and I look okay, but I could be hearing voices in my mind, or I could be going back and forth with my own self. I don't know, it's one of the worst things I've ever experienced, like being punched in the face or grueling training, or whatever has happened to me in my life.

So, I went to the park and stopped for half an hour. If you ask me if I am very bad at fuel meter, why do you ask me if I am bad at fuel meter because of the petrol tank empty? Similarly, our sadness, depression, sudden down feeling, all these are not a problem. It is a symptom or a problem. So, why is it a problem? We cannot solve it. For the problems that we cannot take a step, our subconscious mind will be exposed to a feeling and emotions. So, when you start looking for a solution for that problem, the emotion will change. Or, if I think that a motivational song is possible, I will stop for 15 minutes and return to this place. So, until we find a solution for this, we will not be able to leave it. So, do you ask me how to identify the problem? There is a simple and effective method for that. I hope you know this. Subscribe to my channel and tell me in the comments. For that, tell me in the next video, the simple and effective method. Bye!"

As a Christian, we tend to think about God knowing our future, and if we're not careful, we'll start viewing him kind of like a fortune teller where he knows it's good, but beyond that, it's unclear. However, we understand from Revelation 22 that God is the beginning and the end. So in the same way, he's already been a part of Genesis and creating everything that we know, he is equally a part of things that we haven't even experienced yet. In other words, he doesn't just know your future, he's in your future. He's already moved the pieces around and orchestrated the details for us to confidently step into. See, we don't serve a God that just looks distantly at where we're going, but we serve a God that has prepared the ground that we are walking into."

These disorders are similar. For quite some time, avoidant was actually conceptualized by many researchers as a more severe version of SAD. This is called the severity continuum hypothesis. This hypothesis has mostly been abandoned in favor of the idea that the two disorders are distinct constructs. Both disorders involve avoidance. The main difference between the disorders is connected with the motive for avoiding social situations. Fears of rejection and feelings of inadequacy motivate people with AVPD to avoid social situations. SAD is more focused on a fear of humiliation or embarrassment."

That morning light exposure is going to also trigger the activation of dopamine release, dopamine being this essentially feel-good neuromodulator. The best way to conceptualize dopamine is that, yes, it's part of the reward system, but it's really the molecule of motivation and positive anticipation. That's really what it's about. And I should mention that the cortisol is going to be released in a pulse once every 24 hours, no matter what. It's coming, as we call it, it's an intrinsic rhythm, but you can time it by viewing light and or by getting exercise early in the day. There are actually data to just kind of emphasize what happens when you don't do this. They showed that if that cortisol pulse shows up later in the day, and especially if it's around 8 or 9 p.m., then it's associated with depression. By shifting that cortisol pulse earlier in the day, you ameliorate some of the symptoms of depression. And because of the dopamine release, you get this overall mood enhancement."

Often it can be difficult to approach somebody you're concerned about with an eating disorder. I'd recommend the are you okay approach. Asking, listening, encouraging and checking in. Often people will push away. They say they don't want to talk. And that's fine. Don't push them. But do ask again at a later point. You might not get someone to open up to you but it might make them realise they're not alone and they then seek their own help. It's vitally important that people feel able to seek help for eating disorders. Even more so if at university that's been the trigger and they're thus away from their normal support groups. Remember recovery is possible but the first step is going to be talking to somebody."

People think that depression has to lead to impairments in your functioning but this is not the case. If your depression causes significant distress and you are still functioning, you still meet criteria for depression. Many people with HFD don’t enjoy things the way they used to and feel compelled to live “all work and no play” lives because they derive a sense of purpose from their work identity. However, they don’t prioritize the simple pleasures that bring joy to life.  #depression #dayinthelife #hfd #priorities #therapy #psychiatry #shorts

Avoiding your fear triggers or situations is called Experiential avoidance. It is the tendency to avoid uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and it is a key factor in how anxiety, panic disorder, health anxiety, agoraphobia and even OCD develops and is maintained.

When some people experience high anxiety, they often misinterpret those feelings to mean that they are in danger or that something terrible is happening and that it can get worse. 
They may have physical symptoms like a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, or sweating. These symptoms can be frightening, and it's natural for people to want to avoid them.

But when people start to avoiding thoughts or environments and situations that they associate with anxiety, they inadvertently reinforce their anxiety. Avoidance sends a message to the brain that the feared thought, situation or bodily sensation is dangerous, which can trigger the fight-or-flight or freeze response and make the anxiety even worse.

Over time, avoidance can lead to a cycle of anxiety, panic or OCD. People may start to avoid more and more situations, which can limit their daily activities and make it difficult for them to function normally. This can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, dread and hopelessness.

Experiential avoidance is not just limited to panic disorder or ocd. It's a common pattern of behavior that can be seen in many different types of anxiety disorders, as well as depression and other mental health conditions. The good news is that there are effective treatments available that can help people break the cycle of avoidance and anxiety.

An effective treatment, a particular type of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) called ERP Exposure and Response Prevention therapy, involves gradually exposing people to the feared situation in a safe and controlled environment.

Fear can be conquered with exposure practice, patience, consistency and determination. It isn’t instantaneous or immediate. It is slow, methodical, committed work and it is committed determination that tames the beast.

There are several risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing BPD, and these include, number one is the genetic component. Research has shown that there may be a genetic component to the disorder. So let's move on to number two, and that is biological. Studies have found that individuals with BPD have changes in the structure and function of certain areas of their brain, and one area that has been found to be affected in BPD is the amygdala, which plays a key role in our stress response. Moving on to number three, environmental factors. Environmental factors can contribute to the development of borderline personality disorder by impacting a person's emotional and psychological development.

Or do you have a terrible life? Or is it some combination of the two? So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell, you don't have a terrible life. You have friends, you have family, you have an intimate relationship, you have a job or a career. Your body's educated as you should be given your intelligence. Use your time outside of work wisely. You're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations. You're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense and all that's working. Now if you have all that and you're feeling really awful, you're either ill or you're depressed. And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route to that, treatment of that. My experience as being as a clinician is if you're depressed but you have a life and you take an antidepressant, it will probably help you a lot. Now maybe you're not depressed. Exactly. You just have a terrible life."

Addiction is a very complicated combination of perhaps a genetic predisposition, but also environment including trauma, early development. It is not something that is simply from lack of willpower or not trying hard enough. So let's start thinking of addiction as an expression of a need and of pain rather than something to be judged."

There's burning yourself, there's like bruising yourself, biting, scratching, picking at wounds and some people use rubber bands and actually you could argue that's a healthier way of self-harming so you don't actually physically damage yourself.

JARED'S BIO: Mental Health. SEL. Motivational Speaker Jared Scott has performed at hundreds of venues since the age of 15. Having over 10 years of experience, most of which took place during his formative years, gives him an experience and understanding that most speakers do not have. Jared was able to document and speak through the journey of becoming an adult and navigate through these pivotal times. Jared’s insight not only helps people of all ages, but will also bridge the gap that lies between contrasting generations. 

The perspective gained from Jared’s speeches has the power to unify people of all generations, ethnicities, backgrounds, and cultures. After all, Jared’s love for public speaking is rooted in the positive effect it has on his audience, which leads to change in their community.",24,1546,10.0,60.0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iVIZqE00_0/hqdefault.jpg,Top youth speakers|top youth speaker|youth speaker|youth motivational speaker|Juan bendana|Josh Shipp|top motivational speaker|motivational speaker|speaker|inspiring speaker|top youth speaker 2022|top education speaker|Best youth motivational speaker|youth inspirational speaker|speaker for high school students|student motivational speaker|student speaker|speaker for college students|conference speaker|keynote speaker|motivational keynote speaker|keynote,2023-12-16 23:37:42,https://youtube.com/shorts/-iVIZqE00_0,0,0,1,0,," When I was a kid we didn't have mental health in the curriculum at school. Nobody taught me how to manage my mind or manage my emotions or talk about my feelings. So I didn't, I suppressed them. But suppressed feelings over time it becomes depression.

You have to learn how to let them out and how to do that properly and safely in a good way in a safe controlled environment and that is what we're trying to create here today."

And at some point, your existence becomes so heavy that you can't carry it anymore. Your existence is way too heavy. The solution is live. Put energy into living. When you put energy into living, you don't need to put so much energy into existing. When you put energy into your existence, you have no energy for life. And that's why it's often very helpful when a person is depressed to simply say to them, stop quetching. Find somebody who has real problems and help them. And that is so curing. Life means who needs me. What am I needed? What contribution can I make outside of myself?"

So when most people are having a panic attack, they're really focused on the breathing in part and getting as much air into their lungs as they can. But by doing that, you're allowing your chest to expand, which allows more blood to flow through your heart, which inevitably makes it beat faster. So although it may seem counterintuitive in the moment, focusing on taking long deep breaths out rather than in will actually decrease that fight or flight instinct a lot faster by decreasing and normalizing your heart rate."

Yeah, okay, that's really common for ADHD. There are a lot of reasons for that. One of the reasons is that we often don't give ourselves time to wind down before bed and yeah, that sounds boring, right? So like finding something to do to wind down that's interesting enough that you don't mind transitioning to it but not so engaging that it keeps us from going to sleep is kind of that sweet spot. So trading massages with a partner, doing some puzzles, reading a book, watching a TV show that you've seen before so it's not not all that interesting, listening to a podcast, these are all great ways to wind down before sleep and we want to start doing it well before bedtime."

These clips will soon be hosted on our YouTube Channel.,"Marijuana or weed linked to schizophrenia? News in under a minute. Experts are concerned about the increasing use by adolescents and young adults, and the evidence is growing the marijuana's association with psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. New research is adding to worries that heavy use of high-potency cannabis and legalization of recreational weed in many U.S. states could exacerbate the nation's mental health crisis in young adults. Thase C. potency is a significant factor in the risk for psychotic disorders, with higher doses consumed increasing the likelihood. Adolescents and young adults are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis as their brains continue to mature. It's crucial to educate the public and regulate the concentration of THC in products. People with a family history of a psychotic disorder shouldn't use cannabis at all."

Many people may find themselves suffering from these mental health issues and facing problems in their lives. However, there is a solution—the only solution is to keep praying. Salah, the act of prayer, can bring tranquility and peace to those who seek it. It is important to continue praying until you find the peace you are searching for. In the journey of life, it is essential to stay calm and relaxed, to find the peace and tranquility we desire. Therefore, one must remember the power of prayer and its ability to bring solace and relief.",

Life without anxiety - with bpd

living with bpd shorts

About the host: 

BPD Recovery - I'm learning to live with Borderline Personality Disorder and Anxiety and Depression.

My intended audience is people interested in mental health education, specifically aiming towards BPD, major depressive disorder, anxiety and depression, trauma, personality disorders, addiction, wellness tips, coping strategies and emotional regulation.

This channel is to show an inside perspective of living with BPD, anxiety and depression and what goes on in the mind of someone who is recovering from those mental health problems. 

I do joke about my mental health and find this helps me to deal with the very real symptoms of my mental health problems. At the same time I hope to bring some humour and comedy to others who are going through the same struggle. I'm still learning to cope and hope you enjoy and maybe relate to my take on my mental health as I go through life and mental health (bpd) recovery.

Psychiatry is the field that deals with mental disorders. It is a spectrum disorder that affects individuals differently. Straight SHU is a term that refers to an individual without any mental disorders. Social anxiety disorder, often abbreviated as SAD, is a specific type of mental illness. It is important to distinguish between different psychological conditions.","Alright, now fact number five is that social anxiety disorder is not the same as autism spectrum disorder. Although they can have similar traits and characteristics, they're two distinct conditions. What we see is that those with autism have difficulties with learning social skills. They struggle with things such as understanding cues, making eye contact, or engaging in back and forth conversations. anxiety disorder is different because these individuals are afraid and scared of situations. So it's not a lack of skills issue. It's a fear-based issue. They're capable at baseline of having relationships, and they have appropriate communication skills. But they become really anxious or scared in these situations, and this sometimes can look like autism. But the big take home message is that these are not the same thing whatsoever."

Well, first of all, Islam very much emphasizes the importance of getting help when is needed. So this is something we find in both the hadith and the Qur'an. And I think this a core part of our tradition. It's the remembrance that everything that Allah has sent in terms of an illness does have a cure, that He doesn't send any illnesses without cures or treatments, and that we need the humility to go get the help when needed. Also built within our faith is grounding principles. Whether these be the prayers or the remembrances of Allah SWT, or actually relying on Him through our difficult moments and times. These practices are core and they're indigenous to the Islamic concept, and so we should definitely look into them."

Now I'm not saying that you should turn off your feelings when it comes to others, but now's the time where you FOCUS a little more on your own healing journey and a little less about what others are going through. 

Stay FOCUSED on what you need to do for your Mental Health Recovery and that way you will be there for the ones that you LOVE. Who knows... you may even be able to lead by example, which might even help your friends and family in the end. 

So take the time that you need for your Mental Health Recovery and Focus on your needs so that you can be there for others when you can.

1. Habit of always expecting good things in life. It is not possible that life will be always on the good side. Some or other time you have to face the bad phase also. Be ready for that.
2. Habit of controlling people for your own happiness. It is not possible that people will always try to make you happy. You have to look for happiness on your terms and conditions.
3. Refuse to forgive people. You have to know how to forgive and forget about whatever mistakes they have done and whenever they made you hurt."
